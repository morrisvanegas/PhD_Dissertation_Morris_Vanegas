abstract = {Three-dimensional surface imaging has gained clinical acceptance in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In contrast to computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional surface imaging relies on triangulation in stereophotography to measure surface x, y, and z coordinates. This study reviews the past, present, and future directions of three-dimensional topographic imaging in plastic surgery. Historically, three-dimensional imaging technology was first used in a clinical setting in 1944 to diagnose orthodontologic conditions. Karlan established its use in the field of plastic surgery in 1979, analyzing contours and documenting facial asymmetries. Present use of three-dimensional surface imaging has focused on standardizing patient topographic measurements to enhance preoperative planning and to improve postoperative outcomes. Various measurements (e.g., volume, surface area, vector distance, curvature) have been applied to breast, body, and facial topography to augment patient analysis. Despite the rapid progression of the clinical applications of three-dimensional imaging, current use of this technology is focused on the surgeon's perspective and secondarily the patient's perspective. Advancements in patient simulation may improve patient-physician communication, education, and satisfaction. However, a communal database of three-dimensional surface images integrated with emerging three-dimensional printing and portable information technology will validate measurements and strengthen preoperative planning and postoperative outcomes. Three-dimensional surface imaging is a useful adjunct to plastic and reconstructive surgery practices and standardizes measurements to create objectivity in a subjective field. Key improvements in three-dimensional imaging technology may significantly enhance the quality of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the near future.},

abstract = {We have developed a novel parallel-plate diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system for three-dimensional in vivo imaging of human breast tumor based on large optical data sets. Images of oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin concentration as well as blood oxygen saturation and tissue scattering were reconstructed. Tumor margins were derived using the optical data with guidance from radiology reports and magnetic resonance imaging. Tumor-to-normal ratios of these endogenous physiological parameters and an optical index were computed for 51 biopsy-proven lesions from 47 subjects. Malignant cancers (N=41) showed statistically significant higher total hemoglobin, oxy-hemoglobin concentration, and scattering compared to normal tissue. Furthermore, malignant lesions exhibited a twofold average increase in optical index. The influence of core biopsy on DOT results was also explored; the difference between the malignant group measured before core biopsy and the group measured more than 1week after core biopsy was not significant. Benign tumors (N=10) did not exhibit statistical significance in the tumor-to-normal ratios of any parameter. Optical index and tumor-to-normal ratios of total hemoglobin, oxy-hemoglobin concentration, and scattering exhibited high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values from 0.90 to 0.99, suggesting good discriminatory power. The data demonstrate that benign and malignant lesions can be distinguished by quantitative three-dimensional DOT. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

In its first year of operation, TCIA accumulated 23 collections (3.3 million images). Operating and maintaining a high-availability image archive is a complex challenge involving varied archive-specific resources and driven by the needs of both image submitters and image consumers.

abstract = {Three-dimensional diffuse optical tomography (DOT) of breast requires large data sets for even modest resolution (1 cm). We present a hybrid DOT system that combines a limited number of frequency domain (FD) measurements with a large set of continuous wave (cw) measurements. The FD measurements are used to quantitatively determine tissue averaged absorption and scattering coefficients. The larger cw data sets (105 measurements) collected with a lens coupled CCD, permit 3D DOT reconstructions of a 1-1iter tissue volume. To address the computational complexity of large data sets and 3D volumes we employ finite difference based reconstructions computed in parallel. Tissue phantom measurements evaluate imaging performance. The tests include the following: point spread function measures of resolution, characterization of the size and contrast of single objects, field of view measurements and spectral characterization of constituent concentrations. We also report in vivo measurements. Average tissue optical properties of a healthy breast are used to deduce oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations. Differential imaging with a tumor simulating target adhered to the surface of a healthy breast evaluates the influence of physiologic fluctuations on image noise. This tomography system provides robust, quantitative, full 3D image reconstructions with the advantages of high data throughput, single detector-tissue coupling path, and large (1L) imaging domains. In addition, we find that point spread function measurements provide a useful and comprehensive representation of system performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

The recovery of optical parameters from boundary measurements of light propagation within tissue is inherently a difficult one, because the problem is nonlinear, ill-posed and ill-conditioned. Additionally, although the measured near-infrared signals of light transmission through tissue provide high imaging contrast, the reconstructed images suffer from poor spatial resolution due to the diffuse propagation of light in biological tissue. The application of model-based image reconstruction is reviewed in this paper, together with a numerical modelling approach to light propagation in tissue as well as generalized image reconstruction using boundary data. A comprehensive review and details of the basis for using spatial and structural prior information are also discussed, whereby the use of spectral and dual-modality systems can improve contrast and spatial resolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Multi-spectral near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is capable of providing functional tissue assessment that can complement structural mammographic images for more comprehensive breast cancer diagnosis. To take full advantage of the readily available sub-millimeter resolution structural information in a multi-modal imaging setting, an efficient x-ray/optical joint image reconstruction model has been proposed previously to utilize anatomical information from a mammogram as a structural prior. In this work, we develop a complex digital breast phantom (available at http://openjd.sf.net/digibreast) based on direct measurements of fibroglandular tissue volume fractions using dual-energy mammographic imaging of a human breast. We also extend our prior-guided reconstruction algorithm to facilitate the recovery of breast tumors, and perform a series of simulation-based studies to systematically evaluate the impact of lesion sizes and contrasts, tissue background, mesh resolution, inaccurate priors, and regularization parameters, on the recovery of breast tumors using multi-modal DOT/x-ray measurements. Our studies reveal that the optical property estimation error can be reduced by half by utilizing structural priors; the minimum detectable tumor size can also be reduced by half when prior knowledge regarding the tumor location is provided. Moreover, our algorithm is shown to be robust to false priors on tumor location.},

To enable tissue function-based tumor diagnosis over the large number of existing digital mammography systems worldwide, we propose a cost-effective and robust approach to incorporate tomographic optical tissue characterization with separately acquired digital mammograms. Using a flexible contour-based registration algorithm, we were able to incorporate an independently measured two-dimensional x-ray mammogram as structural priors in a joint optical/x-ray image reconstruction, resulting in improved spatial details in the optical images and robust optical property estimation. We validated this approach with a retrospective clinical study of 67 patients, including 30 malignant and 37 benign cases, and demonstrated that the proposed approach can help to distinguish malignant from solid benign lesions and fibroglandular tissues, with a performance comparable to the approach using spatially coregistered optical/x-ray measurements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cumulative risk of a false positive result from a breast-cancer screening test is unknown. METHODS: We performed a 10-year retrospective cohort study of breast-cancer screening and diagnostic evaluations among 2400 women who were 40 to 69 years old at study entry. Mammograms or clinical breast examinations that were interpreted as indeterminate, aroused a suspicion of cancer, or prompted recommendations for additional workup in women in whom breast cancer was not diagnosed within the next year were considered to be false positive tests. RESULTS: A total of 9762 screening mammograms and 10,905 screening clinical breast examinations were performed, for a median of 4 mammograms and 5 clinical breast examinations per woman over the 10-year period. Of the women who were screened, 23.8 percent had at least one false positive mammogram, 13.4 percent had at least one false positive breast examination, and 31.7 percent had at least one false positive result for either test. The estimated cumulative risk of a false positive result was 49.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 40.3 to 64.1 percent) after 10 mammograms and 22.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19.2 to 27.5 percent) after 10 clinical breast examinations. The false positive tests led to 870 outpatient appointments, 539 diagnostic mammograms, 186 ultrasound examinations, 188 biopsies, and 1 hospitalization. We estimate that among women who do not have breast cancer, 18.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 9.8 to 41.2 percent) will undergo a biopsy after 10 mammograms, and 6.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 11.2 percent) after 10 clinical breast examinations. For every 100 dollars spent for screening, an additional 33 dollars was spent to evaluate the false positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Over 10 years, one third of women screened had an abnormal test result that required additional evaluation, even though no breast cancer was present. Techniques are needed to decrease false positive results while maintaining high sensitivity. Physicians should educate women about the risk of a false positive result from a screening test for breast cancer.},

abstract = {PurposeTo explore the optical and physiologic properties of normal and lesion-bearing breasts by using a combined optical and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging system.Materials and MethodsInstitutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Combined optical and tomosynthesis imaging analysis was performed in 189 breasts from 125 subjects (mean age, 56 years ± 13 [standard deviation]), including 138 breasts with negative findings and 51 breasts with lesions. Three-dimensional (3D) maps of total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), oxygen saturation (So2), and tissue reduced scattering coefficients were interpreted by using the coregistered DBT images. Paired and unpaired t tests were performed between various tissue types to identify significant differences.ResultsThe estimated average bulk HbT from 138 normal breasts was 19.2 ?mol/L. The corresponding mean So2 was 0.73, within the range of values in the literature. A linear correlation (R = 0.57, P < .0001) was found between HbT and the fibroglandular volume fraction derived from the 3D DBT scans. Optical reconstructions of normal breasts revealed structures corresponding to chest-wall muscle, fibroglandular, and adipose tissues in the HbT, So2, and scattering images. In 26 malignant tumors of 0.6?2.5 cm in size, HbT was significantly greater than that in the fibroglandular tissue of the same breast (P = .0062). Solid benign lesions (n = 17) and cysts (n = 8) had significantly lower HbT contrast than did the malignant lesions (P = .025 and P = .0033, respectively).ConclusionThe optical and DBT images were structurally consistent. The malignant tumors and benign lesions demonstrated different HbT and scattering contrasts, which can potentially be exploited to reduce the false-positive rate of conventional mammography and unnecessary biopsies.?

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a noninvasive, nonionizing imaging modality that uses near-infrared light to visualize optically relevant chromophores. A recently developed dynamic DOT imaging system enables the study of hemodynamic effects in the breast during a breath-hold. Dynamic DOT imaging was performed in a total of 21 subjects (age 54±10  years) including 3 healthy subjects and 18 subjects with benign (n=8) and malignant (n=14) masses. Three-dimensional time-series images of the percentage change in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations ([HbO2] and [Hb]) from baseline are obtained over the course of a breath-hold. At a time point of 15 s following the end of the breath-hold, [Hb] in healthy breasts has returned to near-baseline values (1.6%±0.5%), while tumor-bearing breasts have increased levels of [Hb] (6.8%±3.6%, p<0.01). Further, healthy subjects have a higher correlation between the breasts over the course of the breath-hold as compared with the subjects with breast cancer (healthy: 0.96±0.02; benign: 0.89±0.02; malignant: 0.78±0.23, p<0.05). Therefore this study shows that dynamic features extracted from DOT measurements can differentiate healthy and diseased breast tissues. These features provide a physiologic method for identifying breast cancer without the need for ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional imaging in breast surgery has several uses clinically. The most practical applications are for the evaluation of breast asymmetries, both congenital and acquired, and for the evaluation of factors affecting breast shape in augmentation mammaplasty. Other uses of three-dimensional imaging that we have found clinically helpful are for evaluation of patients desiring reduction mammaplasty and for evaluation of patients undergoing unilateral breast reconstruction to determine the expander and permanent implant size that gives the best symmetry with the contralateral breast. We present five cases in which we investigate the use of three-dimensional imaging clinically by using the images to determine quantitative information about the breast, such as volume or projection. Overall, three-dimensional imaging is very helpful in providing objective information about the breast for use in preoperative planning. In addition, by analyzing clinical cases, it can provide objective data about the breast and surgical mammaplasty (especially augmentation mammaplasty) that may help surgeons better understand those factors that contribute to breast shape and influence surgical outcomes. There are currently some limitations of this system, influenced by patients with significant ptosis or obesity, which may introduce errors into the three-dimensional data, making them unreliable. However, we believe three-dimensional imaging has great clinical potential in surgical mammaplasty.},

abstract = {Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (DOT), one of the most sophisticated optical imaging techniques for observations through biological tissue, allows 3-D quantitative imaging of optical properties, which include functional and anatomical information. With DOT, it is expected to be possible to overcome the limitations of conventional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as well as offering the potential for diagnostic optical imaging. However, DOT has been under development for more than 30 years, and the difficulties in development are attributed to the fact that light is strongly scattered and that diffusive photons are used for the image reconstruction. The DOT algorithm is based on the techniques of inverse problems. The radiative transfer equation accurately describes photon propagation in biological tissue, while, because of its high computation load, the diffusion equation (DE) is often used as the forward model. However, the DE is invalid in low-scattering and/or highly absorbing regions and in the vicinity of light sources. The inverse problem is inherently ill-posed and highly undetermined. Here, we first summarize NIRS and then describe various approaches in the efforts to develop accurate and efficient DOT algorithms and present some examples of clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of DOT.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.A multi-view three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry system was developed to capture 3D shape of breasts for breast cancer patients. The patients had received immediate unilateral breast reconstruction after mastectomy by the extended latissimus dorsi flap and without contralateral surgery. In order to capture the whole breast shape including the inframammary fold, the patients were introduced to the imaging room and leaned over the imaging rig to open up the inframammary fold and to expose the entire area of each breast. The imaging system consisted of eight high-resolution ((Formula presented.) pixels) digital cameras and four flash units. The cameras were arranged in four stereo pairs from four different view angles to cover the whole surface of the breasts. The system calibration was carried out ahead of every capture session, and the stereo images were matched to generate four range images to be integrated using an elastic model proposed. A watertight breast mesh model was reconstructed to measure the volume of the breast captured. The accuracy of using the developed multi-view stereophotogrammetry system for breast volume measurement was 11.12cc with SEM 7.74cc, comparing to the measurements of the water displacement method. It was concluded that the 3D stereophotogrammetry image system developed was more reliable than the method of water displacement.},

Matching between such pairs of images is considered essential by radiologists for more reliable diagnosis of early breast cancer. The two images are taken while the breast is compressed between the cassette and plate of the X-ray machine, but, almost always, to a different extent in each direction. The deformations of the breast caused by the different compressions in the different directions causes corresponding points to appear far from the straight 'epipolar lines' familiar from binocular stereo vision. The method developed in this paper calculates the line in a MLO image corresponding to a point in the CC image through simulation of the deformation and the projection of a 3D line(curve) corresponding to the point. Experiments using actual images show that the method gives good predictions which can be used to find exact correspondences between points in the two images.},

abstract = {Background: Breast volume is a relevant measure for the prevention and prediction of diseases and for aesthetic surgery. This study evaluated a new technique to determine breast volume and compared measures using a three-dimensional (3D) body surface scanner and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, with the latter used as the standard method. Methods: Both MRI scans and body surface 3D scans were obtained from 22 women. For each method, breast volumes were assessed. The MRI calculations of the breast volumes were performed by a specially trained radiologist using analysis software. A textured 3D image was generated by a calibrated digital texture camera after breast surface data acquisition. The volume assessment of the 3D photography was calculated using a software package after manual outlining of the breast and automated projection of a dorsal limit. Linear regression was used to predict the MRI volume assessment with the 3D image volume assessment. Results: The mean breast volume according to MRI volumetry was 442.8 ml on the left side and 471.8 ml on the right side. The mean breast volume using a 3D body surface volume assessment method was 273.8 ml (observer A) and 226.2 ml (observer B) on the left side and 284.4 ml (observer A) and 234.9 ml (observer B) on the right side. The use of linear regression models showed R 2 values of 0.59-0.77. The mean time for MRI recording and volume assessment was 68.0 ± 14.1 min for both sides and 11.6 ± 1.5 min for 3D recording and volume assessment. Conclusions: The 3D surface-based volume measurements are feasible in terms of time and can predict the MRI breast volume with sufficient accuracy. This might facilitate the broad use of such an assessment technique in a large-scale epidemiologic study using breast volume as a study aim. Additionally, further development of volume assessments could help to implement this technique in breast surgery procedures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.},

abstract = {Quantification of the complex breast region can be helpful in breast surgery, which is shaped by subjective influences. However, there is no generally recognized method for breast volume calculation. Three-dimensional (3D) body surface imaging represents a new alternative for breast volume computation. The aim of this work was to compare breast volume calculation with 3D scanning and three classic methods, focusing on relative advantages, disadvantages, and reproducibility. Repeated breast volume calculations of both breasts in six patients (n=12) were performed using a 3D laser scanner, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thermoplastic castings, and anthropomorphic measurements. Mean volumes (cc) and mean measurement deviations were calculated, and regression analyses were performed. MRI showed the highest measurement precision, with a mean deviation (expressed as a percentage of mean breast volume) of 1.56±0.52% compared with 2.27±0.99% for the 3D scanner, 7.97±3.53% for thermoplastic castings, and 6.26±1.56% for the anthropomorphic measurements. Breast volume calculations using MRI showed the best agreement with 3D scanning measurement (r=0.990), followed by anthropomorphic measurement (r=0.947), and thermoplastic castings (r=0.727). Compared with three classical methods of breast volume calculation, 3D scanning provides acceptable accuracy for breast volume measurements, better spatial interpretation of the anatomical area to be operated on (due to lack of chest deformation), non-invasiveness, and good patient tolerance. After this preliminary study and further development, we believe that 3D body surface scanning could provide better preoperative planning and postoperative control in everyday clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract: Precise and objective calculation of breast volume is helpful to evaluate the aesthetic result of breast surgery, but traditional methods are unsatisfactory. Three-dimensional (3D) scanning of the body surface allows reproducible and objective assessment of the complex breast region but requires further investigation before clinical application. The main goal of this study was to investigate the precision and accuracy of breast volume measurement using 3D body scanning. Five independent observers standardized the 3D scanning method using 2 dummy models (n = 200) and examined its applicability with 6 test subjects and 10 clinical patients (n = 2220). Breast volume measurements obtained with the 3D-scanner technology were compared with reference measurements obtained from test subjects through nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The mean deviation of the breast volume measurements of 1 test subject by all observers, expressed as percentage of volume, was 2.86 ± 0.98, significantly higher than the deviation for the dummy models, 1.65 ± 0.42 (P < 0.001). With respect to all clinical patients, the mean measurement precision obtained preoperatively was less precise than that obtained postoperatively (3.31 ± 1.02 versus 1.66 ± 0.49, respectively). Interobserver differences in measurement precision were not statistically significant. The mean breast volumes obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (441.42 ± 137.05 mL) and 3D scanning (452.51 ± 141.88 mL) significantly correlated (r = 0.995, P < 0.001). Breast volume measurement with 3D surface imaging represents a sufficiently precise and accurate method to guarantee objective and exact recording.},

abstract = {A Near Infrared Spectral Tomography (NIRST) system has been developed and integrated into a commercial Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) scanner to allow structural and functional imaging of breast in vivo. The NIRST instrument uses an 8-wavelength continuous wave (CW) laserbased scanning source assembly and a 75-element silicon photodiode solidstate detector panel to produce dense spectral and spatial projection data from which spectrally constrained 3D tomographic images of tissue chromophores are produced. Integration of the optical imaging system into the DBT scanner allows direct co-registration of the optical and DBT imageswhile also facilitating the synergistic use of x-ray contrast as anatomical priors in optical image reconstruction. Currentlythe total scan time for a combined NIRST-DBT exam is ∼50s with data collection from 8 wavelengths in the optical scan requiring ∼42s to complete. The system was tested in breast simulating phantoms constructed using intralipid and blood in an agarose matrix with a 3 cm x 2 cm cylindrical inclusion at 1 cm depth from the surface. Diffuse image reconstruction of total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration resulted in accurate recovery of the lateral size and position of the inclusion to within 6% and 8%respectively. Use of DBT structural priors in the NIRST reconstruction process improved the quantitative accuracy of the HbT recoveryand led to linear changes in imaged versus actual contrastunderscoring the advantages of dual-modality optical imaging approaches. The quantitative accuracy of the system can be further improved with independent measurements of scattering properties through integration of frequency or time domain data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The analysis of 2D mammographic images can be difficult due to the projective nature of the imaging technique and poor contrast between tumorous and healthy fibro-glandular tissue. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can overcome these disadvantages by providing a 3D dataset of the breast. The detection of corresponding image structures is challenging due to large breast deformations during the image acquisition. We present a method for analyzing 2D/3D intra-individual correspondences between mammography and MRI datasets. Therefore, an ICP-based B-spline registration is used to approximate the breast deformation differences. The resulting deformed MR image is projected onto the 2D plane to enable a comparison with the 2D mammogram. A first evaluation based on six mammograms revealed an average accuracy of 4.87 mm. In contrast to previous FEM-based approaches, we propose a fast and easy to implement 3D/3D-registration, for simulating the mammographic breast compression. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

abstract = {Screening X-ray mammography is limited by false positives and negatives leading to unnecessary physical and psychological morbidity. Diffuse Optical Imaging using harmless near infra red light, provides lesion detection based on functional abnormalities and represents a novel diagnostic arm that could complement traditional mammography. Reviews of optical breast imaging have not been systematic, are focused mainly on technological developments, and have become superseded by rapid technological advancement. The aim of this study is to review clinically orientated studies involving approximately 2,000 women in whom optical mammography has been used to evaluate the healthy or diseased breast. The results suggest that approximately 85% of breast lesions are detectable on optical mammography. Spectroscopic resolution of tissue haemoglobin composition and oxygen saturation may improve the detectability of breast diseases. Results suggest that breast lesions contain approximately twice the haemoglobin concentration of background tissue. Current evidence suggests that it is not possible to distinguish benign from malignant disease using optical imaging techniques in isolation. Methods to improve the performance of Diffuse Optical Imaging, such as better spectral coverage with additional wavelengths, improved modelling of light transport in tissues and the use of extrinsic dyes may augment lesion detection and characterisation. Future research should involve large clinical trials to determine the overall sensitivity and specificity of optical imaging techniques as well as to establish patient satisfaction and economic viability.},

abstract = {Structured-light systems are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.},

It was hypothesized that knowledge of preoperative and postoperative breast volumes might facilitate obtaining symmetry after reconstructions with autologous tissue or implants. Breast reconstruction was performed for 382 women during a 4-year period. Of those women, 334 completed all phases of the reconstruction and underwent symmetry analysis. Reconstructive procedures included the use of pedicle transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flaps, free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flaps, deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps, superior gluteal artery perforator flaps, or latissimus dorsi flaps or expanders/implants. Three-dimensional digital photographic images were obtained for 33 women, whereas the remaining 301 women were not digitally photographed. The differences in symmetry after the initial reconstruction and after the secondary procedures were compared for all women and for the groups with and without three-dimensional photographic images. For the group with three-dimensional imaging, initial volume symmetry was obtained for 73 percent, initial contour symmetry was obtained for 27 percent, secondary procedures were necessary for 70 percent, final volume symmetry was obtained for 88 percent, and final contour symmetry was obtained for 79 percent. For the group without three-dimensional photographic images, initial volume symmetry was obtained for 57 percent, initial contour symmetry was obtained for 34 percent, secondary procedures were necessary for 50 percent, final volume symmetry was obtained for 80 percent, and final contour symmetry was obtained for 71 percent. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in final contour and volume symmetry between women who had or did not have three-dimensional digital photographic images taken. However, the results demonstrated that autologous tissue reconstructions resulted in improved contour and volume symmetry, compared with implant reconstructions.},

abstract = {Purpose: Breast density is considered a significant risk factor and an important biomarker influencing the later risk of breast cancer. Prior breast segmentation is required when quantifying breast density with MRI in order to calculate the total breast volume and exclude nonbreast surrounding tissues. This paper describes an automatic 3D breast volume segmentation approach. Methods: The method is based on 3D local edge detection using phase congruency and Poisson surface reconstruction to extract the total breast volume. The boundary localization framework is integrated to a subsequent shape atlas-based segmentation using a Laplacian framework. Results: The 3D segmentation achieves breast-air and breast-chest wall boundary localization errors with a median of 1.36 mm and 2.68 mm, respectively, and an average volume error of 153.8 cm 3 when tested on 409 MRI datasets. Furthermore, the breast volume assessment technique will produce a 5.3 variability in the estimation of breast density in the tested population. Conclusions: The fully automated segmentation approach of the breast in MRI allows the computation of total breast volume, a step required for breast density assessment. The use of features invariant to image intensity and a shape atlas to reinforce shape consistency are attractive characteristics of the method. Error analysis demonstrates that 5.3 variability in the estimation of breast density incurred by the method is an acceptable trade-off. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Background: Wire localization for excision of nonpalpable breast cancer is an inefficient and inexact technique. Methods: A total of 18 women with palpable invasive breast cancers underwent preoperative prone and supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraoperatively, the edges of the tumor were palpated and marked on the skin surface. The breast was optically scanned, and the supine MRI was adjusted to match the actual breast position at the time of surgery. Image-defined tumor edges were marked on the surface of the breast. The main outcome measure was the distance between the image-defined and palpation-defined edges of the tumor. Results: No significant difference was found between the mean maximal tumor diameter as measured by histopathology (29.6 ± 14.3 mm), supine MRI (25.3 ± 9.7 mm), prone MRI (27.6 ± 13 mm), or palpation (30.5 ± 9.3 mm). The distance from the tumor to the chest wall was markedly different in prone versus supine MRI (56.4 ± 38 vs 19.5 ± 20 mm, p =.002). The average distance between the palpated and supine MRI image-defined tumor edge locations was 7.2 mm (range, 0-19 mm). Accuracy improved over time; the average difference in edge locations in the last 7 patients was 4.0 mm. All 4 image-defined edge locations in the last 5 patients were ≤1 cm away from the palpated locations. Conclusions: We have developed a method of breast tumor localization using preoperative supine MRI and intraoperative optical scanning that defines tumor size and position as accurately as palpation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 SPIE. Some image processing techniques for digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) require or assume prior knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the compressed breast. Our goal is to characterize the breast shape curvature during mechanical compression for DM and DBT acquisition, and to study its dependencies on relevant patient features to improve this prior knowledge. For this, patients were recruited to undergo 3D breast surface scanning during breast compression for their clinical DBT examination. This surface scanning system included two sets of a digital projector with a pair of stereoscopic structured light cameras, positioned at opposite sides of the DBT system. Features from the patients were extracted from the DBT images while the 3D surfaces were used as input to a previously developed principal component analysis (PCA) breast shape model. From the cases included in this study, 70 scans with full breast coverage and without artefacts were selected for this interim analysis. The enhanced coverage with the stereoscopic setup resulted in improved characterization of the breast shape curvature, yielding an asymmetry in the curvature between medial and lateral side. Linear correlation between the first PCA component and the thickness of the breast was found, but not for the other components. A multiple linear regression analysis was applied, finding no significant correlation between curve shape and patient characteristics. Searching for other factors that could be used to predict the breast shape when compressed, and testing for non-linear correlations will be addressed as a next step.},

abstract = {Many modern sensors used for mapping produce 3D point clouds, which are typically registered together using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Because ICP has many variants whose performances depend on the environment and the sensor, hundreds of variations have been published. However, no comparison frameworks are available, leading to an arduous selection of an appropriate variant for particular experimental conditions. The first contribution of this paper consists of a protocol that allows for a comparison between ICP variants, taking into account a broad range of inputs. The second contribution is an open-source ICP library, which is fast enough to be usable in multiple real-world applications, while being modular enough to ease comparison of multiple solutions. This paper presents two examples of these field applications. The last contribution is the comparison of two baseline ICP variants using data sets that cover a rich variety of environments. Besides demonstrating the need for improved ICP methods for natural, unstructured and information-deprived environments, these baseline variants also provide a solid basis to which novel solutions could be compared. The combination of our protocol, software, and baseline results demonstrate convincingly how open-source software can push forward the research in mapping and navigation.},

abstract = {To characterize and develop a patient-based 3D model of the compressed breast undergoing mammography and breast tomosynthesis. During this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 50 women were recruited to undergo 3D breast surface imaging with structured light (SL) during breast compression, along with simultaneous acquisition of a tomosynthesis image. A pair of SL systems were used to acquire 3D surface images by projecting 24 different patterns onto the compressed breast and capturing their reflection off the breast surface in approximately 12-16 s. The 3D surface was characterized and modeled via principal component analysis. The resulting surface model was combined with a previously developed 2D model of projected compressed breast shapes to generate a full 3D model. Data from ten patients were discarded due to technical problems during image acquisition. The maximum breast thickness (found at the chest-wall) had an average value of 56 mm, and decreased 13% towards the nipple (breast tilt angle of 5.2°). The portion of the breast not in contact with the compression paddle or the support table extended on average 17 mm, 18% of the chest-wall to nipple distance. The outermost point along the breast surface lies below the midline of the total thickness. A complete 3D model of compressed breast shapes was created and implemented as a software application available for download, capable of generating new random realistic 3D shapes of breasts undergoing compression. Accurate characterization and modeling of the breast curvature and shape was achieved and will be used for various image processing and clinical tasks.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

abstract = {Background: The long term effect of mammographic service screening is not well established. We aimed to assess the long-term effect of mammographic screening on death from breast cancer, taking into account potential biases from self-selection, changes in breast cancer incidence, and classification of cause of death. Methods: We compared deaths from breast cancer diagnosed in the 20 years before screening was introduced (1958-77) with those from breast cancer diagnosed in the 20 years after the introduction of screening (1978-97) in two Swedish counties, in 210 000 women aged 20-69 years. We also compared deaths from all cancers and from all causes in patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the 20 years before and after screening was introduced. In the analysis, data were stratified into age-groups invited for screening (40-69 years) and not invited (20-39 years), and by whether or not the women had actually received screening. We also analysed mortality for the 40-49-year age-group separately. Findings: The unadjusted risk of death from breast cancer dropped significantly in the second screening period compared with the first in women aged 40-69 years (relative risk [RR] 0.77 [95% CI 0.7-0.85]; p<0.0001). No such decline was seen in 20-39 year olds. After adjustment for age, self-selection bias, and changes in breast-cancer incidence in the 40-69 years age-group, breast-cancer mortality was reduced in women who were screened (0.56; 0.49-0.64 p<0.0001), in those who were not screened (0.84 [0.71-0.99]; p=0.03), and in screened and unscreened women combined (0.59 [0.53-0.66]; p<0.0001). After adjustment for age, self-selection bias, and changes in incidence in the 40-49-year age-group, deaths from breast cancer fell significantly in those who were screened (0.52 [0.4-0.67]; p<0.0001); and in all women, screened and unscreened combined (0.55 [0.44-0.7] p<0.0001) but not in unscreened women (p=0.2). In both 40-69-year and 40-49-year age-groups, reductions in deaths from all cancers and from all-causes in women with breast cancer were consistent with these results. Interpretation Taking account of potential biases, changes in clinical practice and changes in the incidence of breast cancer, mammography screening is contributing to substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality in these two Swedish counties.},

abstract = {The first time-resolved optical mammograph operating beyond 900 nm was tested in a retrospective clinical study involving 194 patients with malignant and benign lesions, to investigate the diagnostic potential for the detection and characterization of breast lesions. For the first part of the study (101 patients with 114 lesions), the system was operated at 683, 785, 913 and 975 nm. Subsequently, to improve the spectral content of optical images, the number of wavelengths was increased (up to 7) and the spectral range was extended (637-985 nm). Late gated intensity and scattering images provide sensitivity to tissue composition (oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin, water and lipids) and physiology (total haemoglobin content and oxygen saturation), as well as to structural changes. Tumours are typically identified because of the strong blood absorption at short wavelengths (637-685 nm), while cysts are characterized by low scattering, leading to a detection rate of approximately 80% for both lesion types, when detection is required in both cranio-caudal and oblique views. The detection rate for other benign lesions, such as fibroadenomas, is presently much lower (<40%). The effectiveness of the technique in localizing and identifying different lesion types was analysed as a function of various parameters (lesion size, compressed breast thickness, age, body mass index, breast parenchymal pattern). The possibility that physiologic changes due to the development of a malignant lesion could affect the entire breast was investigated. The capacity to assess the density of breast based on the average scattering properties was also tested.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast shape is largely determined by the volume of tissue and surface area of the skin envelope. Values for breast surface area have never been published in the literature. The investigators have developed an inexpensive, noninvasive optical method to objectively measure breast volume and surface area, and its accuracy is determined. METHODS: An optical grid is projected onto the breast, and two images are captured to create a computerized three-dimensional model from which volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection are calculated. RESULTS: To assess accuracy, simple geometric shapes (n = 22) were analyzed, and the actual volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were compared with the imaged values using least-squares linear regression. There was excellent correlation in all three parameters (r  >  0.995, p  <  10). The mean differences in volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were 28 ± 28 ml (mean ± SD), 2 ± 9 cm, and 0.4 ± 0.5 cm, respectively. Female breasts (n = 14) were then analyzed, and the actual volume and surface area were measured using plaster casts. Based on least-squares linear regression, there was excellent correlation between the imaged values and actual values (r  >  0.992, p  <  10), and the mean differences in volume and surface area were 32 ± 22 ml and 3 ± 11 cm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, an optical method has been demonstrated to measure volume and surface area with accuracy. When the method is applied to the breast, measurement errors are small and clinically insignificant. The ability to facilitate quantitative breast surgery will be investigated in future phases of this experiment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

The source array consists of 56 surface-mounted micro light-emitting diodes (LEDs), each integrating three wavelengths (660, 750, and 840 nm). The detector array is arranged with 56 miniaturized surface-mounted optical sensors, each encapsulating a high-sensitivity photodiode (PD) and a low-noise current amplifier with a gain of 24×. The system provides 3,136 pairs of source-detector measurements at each wavelength, and the fiber-free design largely ensures consistency between source/detection channels while effectively reducing the complexity of system operation and maintenance. We have evaluated the compact-DOTB system's characteristics and demonstrated its performance in terms of reconstruction positioning accuracy and recovery contrast with breast-sized phantom experiments. Furthermore, the breast cancer patient studies have been carried out, and the quantitative results indicate that the compact-DOTB system is able to observe the changes in the functional tissue components of the breast after receiving the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), demonstrating the great potential of the proposed compact system for clinical applications, while its cost and ease of operation are competitive with the existing breast-DOT devices.},

abstract = {Modeling 3D objects and scenes is an important part of computer graphics. One approach to modeling is projecting binary patterns onto the scene in order to obtain correspondences and reconstruct a densely sampled 3D model. In such structured light systems, determining whether a pixel is directly illuminated by the projector is essential to decoding the patterns. In this paper, we introduce a robust, efficient, and easy to implement pixel classification algorithm for this purpose. Our method correctly establishes the lower and upper bounds of the possible intensity values of an illuminated pixel and of a non-illuminated pixel. Based on the two intervals, our method classifies a pixel by determining whether its intensity is within one interval and not in the other. Experiments show that our method improves both the quantity of decoded pixels and the quality of the final reconstruction producing a dense set of 3D points, inclusively for complex scenes with indirect lighting effects. Furthermore, our method does not require newly designed patterns; therefore, it can be easily applied to previously captured data.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is one of the emerging modalities for the non-invasive imaging of thick biological tissues using near-infrared (NIR) light. This article reviews the fundamentals and development of DOT technology since its advent in the early 1990s, including the modeling of light propagation in biological tissues which strongly scatter and weakly absorb NIR light, the optical properties of biological tissues in the NIR wavelength range, three typical measurement methods, image reconstruction algorithms, and so forth. Then various studies are referred to for improvement of the DOT images, which are essentially low in quality due to the ill-conditioned and underdetermined problem. Studies and clinical applications presently attracting much attention are discussed in some detail. Finally, the expected future developments are summarized.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: Breast symmetry, size, and shape are key components of aesthetic outcomes of augmentation mammoplasty, reduction, and reconstruction. Many have claimed that the 3D scanning technique, which measures breast volumes directly and assesses the asymmetry of the chest and breast on a 3D model, is superior to anthropometric measuring in accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. The documented methods of 3D body surface imaging include laser scanning, stereo photography and so on. To achieve ideal aesthetic results, individualized surgery planning based on a reliable virtual model of the prospective surgery outcome could be of considerable value in decision making and assisting in guidance for the surgery procedure. Additionally, the 3D scanning technique is applicable in postoperative monitoring of morphological change, notably, in a dynamic way. Another distinguishing feature is that it enables virtual division of breast volume, thus surgeons could virtually divide the breast volumes into portions using 3D scanning during the programming and evaluation of surgery plans. However, because 3D surface scanning cannot look through the breast substances and reach the interspace between the chest and posterior border of the breast/dorsal limit of the breast, the inframammary fold in larger breasts cannot be correctly imaged, leaving the preoperative inframammary fold reference lacking. Therefore, 3D scanning is thought to be inaccurate in large and/or ptotic breasts. Another fact that prevents 3D scanning from wide application is its high cost and lack of access.\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

@article{Yushkevich2006,
abstract = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zimmermann2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is emerging as a noninvasive functional imaging method for breast cancer diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. In particular, the multimodal approach of combining DOT with x-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is especially synergistic as DBT prior information can be used to enhance the DOT reconstruction. DOT, in turn, provides a functional information overlay onto the mammographic images, increasing sensitivity and specificity to cancer pathology. We describe a dynamic DOT apparatus designed for tight integration with commercial DBT scanners and providing a fast (up to 1 Hz) image acquisition rate to enable tracking hemodynamic changes induced by the mammographic breast compression. The system integrates 96 continuous-wave and 24 frequency-domain source locations as well as 32 continuous wave and 20 frequency-domain detection locations into low-profile plastic plates that can easily mate to the DBT compression paddle and x-ray detector cover, respectively. We demonstrate system performance using static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms as well as in vivo images acquired from the pool of patients recalled for breast biopsies at the Massachusetts General Hospital Breast Imaging Division.},
