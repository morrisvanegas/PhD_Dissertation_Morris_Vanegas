abstract = {Twenty-eight patients with a total of 35 suspect breast masses underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with [fluorine-18] 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in order to study the utility of this technique in the evaluation of breast cancer. FDG PET allowed discrimination between eight benign and 27 malignant breast masses, with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%. Among the malignancies, there was a significant correlation between normalized FDG uptake and nuclear grade (P = .006). In addition, the results of PET imaging were compared with results of axillary node dissection in 20 cases of breast cancer. PET allowed correct categorization of 10 of 10 axillae as negative (specificity = 100%). PET results were equivocal in one axilla and positive in the remaining nine of 10 axillae with positive dissection results (sensitivity = 90%). The authors conclude that FDG PET may give useful information on breast masses and axillary node status prior to surgery.},

abstract = {Multi-modal integration, which combines multiple neurophysiological signals, is gaining more attention for its potential to supplement single modality's drawbacks and yield reliable results by extracting complementary features. In particular, integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is cost-effective and portable, and therefore is a fascinating approach to brain-computer interface (BCI). However, outcomes from the integration of these two modalities have yielded only modest improvement in BCI performance because of the lack of approaches to integrate the two different features. In addition, mismatch of recording locations may hinder further improvement. In this literature review, we surveyed studies of the integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI thoroughly and discussed its current limitations. We also suggested future directions for efficient and successful multi-modal integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years, much of the focus in monitoring child mortality has been on assessing changes in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR). However, as the U5MR decreases, the share of neonatal deaths (within the first month) tends to increase, warranting increased efforts in monitoring the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in addition to the U5MR. OBJECTIVE Data on neonatal deaths comes from a range of sources across different countries, with the amount of data available and the quality of data varying widely. Our objective in estimating the NMR globally is to combine all data sources available to obtain accurate estimates, be able to project mortality levels, and have some indication of the uncertainty in the estimates and projections. METHODS We present a new model for estimating the NMR for countries worldwide, using a Bayesian hierarchical model framework. CONTRIBUTION Our modeling approach offers an intuitive way to share information across different countries and time points, and incorporates different sources of error into the estimates. It also improves on previous modeling approaches by allowing for trends observed in NMR to be more driven by the data available, rather than trends in covariates.},

abstract = {Radiation therapy plays an integral role in the multidisciplinary management of breast cancer. In appropriately selected patients, radiotherapy not only prevents local recurrences by eliminating residual disease but also results in improved survival. However, not all patients have the same risk of harboring residual locoregional disease, resulting in considerable controversy regarding the role of radiotherapy in individual scenarios. Evidence from clinical trials and observational data analyses can help identify which patients with breast cancer are most likely to achieve a net benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy, both after lumpectomy and mastectomy. Additionally, evidence is emerging now about novel approaches in breast radiotherapy that may reduce burden or toxicity in ways that can optimize the therapeutic ratio, including hypofractionated whole breast radiation, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT), and cardiac avoidance techniques. The objective of this chapter is to review both established and emerging evidence regarding these important issues in an effort to clarify the rationale for increasingly complex and individualized decisions regarding breast radiotherapy.},

One example of such a device is a pulse oximeter: a vital instrument that measures blood oxygen saturation. A modern medical grade pulse oximeter is often physically large and requires training and access to a mains power. All such points are contrary to operation in a remote low-income locale. This project covers the design, fabrication, and testing of a testbed pulse oximeter that is targeted for use in the developing world. While developing areas may be lacking infrastructure, mobile phones are readily available. Mobile phones provide a source of power, computation, and access to information that was previously unavailable. By connecting through the headset jack, the testbed design utilizes the phone's capabilities run a pulse oximeter. Data was acquired from the testbed and then analyzed with good results. Global access to point-of-care medical devices can be significantly improved with further use of mobile computing. This will lead to reductions in cost, increased portability, improved patient compliance, and expanded distribution of medical knowledge.},

The aim of these short-separation channels is to measure the same superficial hemodynamics observed by standard fNIRS channels while also being insensitive to the brain. We use Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport in anatomically informed multilayer models to deter- mine the optimum source–detector distance for short-separation channels in adult and newborn populations. We present a look-up plot that provides (for an acceptable value of short-separation channel brain sensitivity relative to standard channel brain sensitivity) the optimum short-separation distance. Though values vary across the scalp, when the acceptable ratio of the short-separation channel brain sensitivity to standard channel brain sensitivity is set at 5%, the optimum short-separation distance is 8.4 mm in the typical adult and 2.15 mm in the term-age infant.},

This knowledge is important because it provides the conceptual basis of appreciating its limitations and recognizing when pulse oximeter readings may be erroneous. In this review, we discuss how pulse oximeters are able to distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin from deoxygenated hemoglobin and how they are able to recognize oxygen saturation only from the arterial compartment of blood.

abstract = {Three-dimensional surface imaging has gained clinical acceptance in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In contrast to computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional surface imaging relies on triangulation in stereophotography to measure surface x, y, and z coordinates. This study reviews the past, present, and future directions of three-dimensional topographic imaging in plastic surgery. Historically, three-dimensional imaging technology was first used in a clinical setting in 1944 to diagnose orthodontologic conditions. Karlan established its use in the field of plastic surgery in 1979, analyzing contours and documenting facial asymmetries. Present use of three-dimensional surface imaging has focused on standardizing patient topographic measurements to enhance preoperative planning and to improve postoperative outcomes. Various measurements (e.g., volume, surface area, vector distance, curvature) have been applied to breast, body, and facial topography to augment patient analysis. Despite the rapid progression of the clinical applications of three-dimensional imaging, current use of this technology is focused on the surgeon's perspective and secondarily the patient's perspective. Advancements in patient simulation may improve patient-physician communication, education, and satisfaction. However, a communal database of three-dimensional surface images integrated with emerging three-dimensional printing and portable information technology will validate measurements and strengthen preoperative planning and postoperative outcomes. Three-dimensional surface imaging is a useful adjunct to plastic and reconstructive surgery practices and standardizes measurements to create objectivity in a subjective field. Key improvements in three-dimensional imaging technology may significantly enhance the quality of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the near future.},

abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional, functional images of the human brain to be obtained using a fibre-less, high-density diffuse optical tomography system. Our technology consists of independent, miniaturized, silicone-encapsulated DOT modules that can be placed directly on the scalp. Four of these modules were arranged to provide up to 128, dual- wavelength measurement channels over a scalp area of approximately 60 × 65 mm2. Using a series of motor-cortex stimulation experiments, we demonstrate that this system can obtain high-quality, continuous-wave measurements at source-detector separations ranging from 14 to 55 mm in adults, in the presence of hair. We identify robust haemodynamic response functions in 5 out of 5 subjects, and present diffuse optical tomography images that depict functional haemodynamic responses that are well-localized in all three dimensions at both the individual and group levels. This prototype modular system paves the way for a new generation of wearable, wireless, high-density optical neuroimaging technologies},

abstract = {We have developed a novel parallel-plate diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system for three-dimensional in vivo imaging of human breast tumor based on large optical data sets. Images of oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin concentration as well as blood oxygen saturation and tissue scattering were reconstructed. Tumor margins were derived using the optical data with guidance from radiology reports and magnetic resonance imaging. Tumor-to-normal ratios of these endogenous physiological parameters and an optical index were computed for 51 biopsy-proven lesions from 47 subjects. Malignant cancers (N=41) showed statistically significant higher total hemoglobin, oxy-hemoglobin concentration, and scattering compared to normal tissue. Furthermore, malignant lesions exhibited a twofold average increase in optical index. The influence of core biopsy on DOT results was also explored; the difference between the malignant group measured before core biopsy and the group measured more than 1 week after core biopsy was not significant. Benign tumors (N=10) did not exhibit statistical significance in the tumor-to-normal ratios of any parameter. Optical index and tumor-to-normal ratios of total hemoglobin, oxy-hemoglobin concentration, and scattering exhibited high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values from 0.90 to 0.99, suggesting good discriminatory power. The data demonstrate that benign and malignant lesions can be distinguished by quantitative three-dimensional DOT.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional diffuse optical tomography (DOT) of breast requires large data sets for even modest resolution (1 cm). We present a hybrid DOT system that combines a limited number of frequency domain (FD) measurements with a large set of continuous wave (cw) measurements. The FD measurements are used to quantitatively determine tissue averaged absorption and scattering coefficients. The larger cw data sets (105 measurements) collected with a lens coupled CCD, permit 3D DOT reconstructions of a 1-1iter tissue volume. To address the computational complexity of large data sets and 3D volumes we employ finite difference based reconstructions computed in parallel. Tissue phantom measurements evaluate imaging performance. The tests include the following: point spread function measures of resolution, characterization of the size and contrast of single objects, field of view measurements and spectral characterization of constituent concentrations. We also report in vivo measurements. Average tissue optical properties of a healthy breast are used to deduce oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations. Differential imaging with a tumor simulating target adhered to the surface of a healthy breast evaluates the influence of physiologic fluctuations on image noise. This tomography system provides robust, quantitative, full 3D image reconstructions with the advantages of high data throughput, single detector-tissue coupling path, and large (1L) imaging domains. In addition, we find that point spread function measurements provide a useful and comprehensive representation of system performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {The ilities are properties of engineering systems that often manifest and determine value after a system is put into initial use (e.g. resilience, interoperability, flexibility). Rather than being primary functional requirements, these properties concern wider system impacts with respect to time and stakeholders. Over the past decade there has been increasing attention to ilities in industry, government and academia. Our research suggests that investigating ilities in sets may be more meaningful than study of single ilities in isolation. Some ilities are closely related and do in fact form semantic sets. Here, we use two methods to investigate over twenty ilities in terms of their prevalence and their interrelationships. We look for trends related to ilities of interest in relation to system type and an understanding of their collective use. First, we conducted a prevalence analysis of 22 ilities using both the internet as well as the Compendex/Inspec database as a source. We found over 1,275,000 scientific articles published between 1884 and 2010 and over 1.9 billion hits on the internet, exposing a clear prevalence-based ranking of ilities. Two questions we seek to address are: why and how are the ilities related to one another, and what can we do with this information. Initial steps to answer the first question include a 2-tupel-correlation matrix analysis that exposes the strongest relationships amongst ilities based on concurrent usage. Moreover, we conducted some preliminary experiments that indicate that a hierarchy of ilities with a few major groupings may be most useful. The overall objective for this research is to develop a formal framework and prescriptive guidance for effectively incorporating sets of ilities into the design of complex engineering systems.},

The recovery of optical parameters from boundary measurements of light propagation within tissue is inherently a difficult one, because the problem is nonlinear, ill-posed and ill-conditioned. Additionally, although the measured near-infrared signals of light transmission through tissue provide high imaging contrast, the reconstructed images suffer from poor spatial resolution due to the diffuse propagation of light in biological tissue. The application of model-based image reconstruction is reviewed in this paper, together with a numerical modelling approach to light propagation in tissue as well as generalized image reconstruction using boundary data. A comprehensive review and details of the basis for using spatial and structural prior information are also discussed, whereby the use of spectral and dual-modality systems can improve contrast and spatial resolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

This review article provides a comprehensive overview of state of the art fNIRS research in psychiatry covering a wide range of applications, including studies on the phenomenological characterization of psychiatric disorders, descriptions of life-time developmental aspects, treatment effects, and genetic influences on neuroimaging data. Finally, methodological shortcomings as well as current research perspectives and promising future applications of fNIRS in psychiatry are discussed. We conclude that fNIRS is a valid addition to the range of neuroscientific methods available to assess neural mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. Future research should particularly focus on expanding the presently used activation paradigms and cortical regions of interest, while additionally fostering technical and methodological advances particularly concerning the identification and removal of extracranial influences on fNIRS data as well as systematic artifact correction. Eventually, fNIRS might be a useful tool in practical psychiatric settings involving both diagnostics and the complementary treatment of psychological disorders using, for example, neurofeedback applications.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to estimate the skin blood flow using infrared light. Researchers from different domains of science have become increasingly interested in PPG because of its advantages as non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient diagnostic tool. Traditionally, it measures the oxygen saturation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and for assessing autonomic functions. Moreover, PPG is a promising technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be helpful for regular GP-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation. Therefore, this overview discusses different types of artifact added to PPG signal, characteristic features of PPG waveform, and existing indexes to evaluate for diagnoses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cumulative risk of a false positive result from a breast-cancer screening test is unknown. METHODS: We performed a 10-year retrospective cohort study of breast-cancer screening and diagnostic evaluations among 2400 women who were 40 to 69 years old at study entry. Mammograms or clinical breast examinations that were interpreted as indeterminate, aroused a suspicion of cancer, or prompted recommendations for additional workup in women in whom breast cancer was not diagnosed within the next year were considered to be false positive tests. RESULTS: A total of 9762 screening mammograms and 10,905 screening clinical breast examinations were performed, for a median of 4 mammograms and 5 clinical breast examinations per woman over the 10-year period. Of the women who were screened, 23.8 percent had at least one false positive mammogram, 13.4 percent had at least one false positive breast examination, and 31.7 percent had at least one false positive result for either test. The estimated cumulative risk of a false positive result was 49.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 40.3 to 64.1 percent) after 10 mammograms and 22.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19.2 to 27.5 percent) after 10 clinical breast examinations. The false positive tests led to 870 outpatient appointments, 539 diagnostic mammograms, 186 ultrasound examinations, 188 biopsies, and 1 hospitalization. We estimate that among women who do not have breast cancer, 18.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 9.8 to 41.2 percent) will undergo a biopsy after 10 mammograms, and 6.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 11.2 percent) after 10 clinical breast examinations. For every 100 dollars spent for screening, an additional 33 dollars was spent to evaluate the false positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Over 10 years, one third of women screened had an abnormal test result that required additional evaluation, even though no breast cancer was present. Techniques are needed to decrease false positive results while maintaining high sensitivity. Physicians should educate women about the risk of a false positive result from a screening test for breast cancer.},

abstract = {Data acquisition is substantially different in PET than it is in planar nuclear medicine and SPECT. There is an entirely different set of definitions and considerations. The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with the terminology and understanding of how PET data are acquired and organized as well as the issues involved in choosing one approach over another. Sinograms and projection views will be presented as methods of storing and viewing raw PET data. Different approaches to increase axial sampling while maintaining a sufficient number of counts for each reconstructed slice are discussed, as well as the use of sinogram compression or "mashing" to reduce the storage requirements of raw PET data. The differences between 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) PET and how storage of raw 3D data may differ from that of 2D data are described. The concept of "Michelograms" as a means of displaying the nature of the axial sampling in both 2D and 3D PET is discussed. After reading this paper, the reader will be able to describe 2 methods used to store and display raw PET data and compare them with methods used in SPECT. The reader will be able to define the terms "span" and "maximum ring difference" and describe how they relate to the axial sampling in 2D and 3D PET. The reader will also be able to list 3 ways in which 3D PET differs from 2D PET.},

abstract = {We report a parallel Monte Carlo algorithm accelerated by graphics processing units (GPU) for modeling time-resolved photon migration in arbitrary 3D turbid media. By taking advantage of the massively parallel threads and low-memory latency, this algorithm allows many photons to be simulated simultaneously in a GPU. To further improve the computational efficiency, we explored two parallel random number generators (RNG), including a floating-point-only RNG based on a chaotic lattice. An efficient scheme for boundary reflection was implemented, along with the functions for time-resolved imaging. For a homogeneous semi-infinite medium, good agreement was observed between the simulation output and the analytical solution from the diffusion theory. The code was implemented with CUDA programming language, and benchmarked under various parameters, such as thread number, selection of RNG and memory access pattern. With a low-cost graphics card, this algorithm has demonstrated an acceleration ratio above 300 when using 1792 parallel threads over conventional CPU computation. The acceleration ratio drops to 75 when using atomic operations. These results render the GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation a practical solution for data analysis in a wide range of diffuse optical imaging applications, such as human brain or small-animal imaging.},

abstract = {PurposeTo explore the optical and physiologic properties of normal and lesion-bearing breasts by using a combined optical and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging system.Materials and MethodsInstitutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Combined optical and tomosynthesis imaging analysis was performed in 189 breasts from 125 subjects (mean age, 56 years ± 13 [standard deviation]), including 138 breasts with negative findings and 51 breasts with lesions. Three-dimensional (3D) maps of total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), oxygen saturation (So2), and tissue reduced scattering coefficients were interpreted by using the coregistered DBT images. Paired and unpaired t tests were performed between various tissue types to identify significant differences.ResultsThe estimated average bulk HbT from 138 normal breasts was 19.2 ?mol/L. The corresponding mean So2 was 0.73, within the range of values in the literature. A linear correlation (R = 0.57, P < .0001) was found between HbT and the fibroglandular volume fraction derived from the 3D DBT scans. Optical reconstructions of normal breasts revealed structures corresponding to chest-wall muscle, fibroglandular, and adipose tissues in the HbT, So2, and scattering images. In 26 malignant tumors of 0.6?2.5 cm in size, HbT was significantly greater than that in the fibroglandular tissue of the same breast (P = .0062). Solid benign lesions (n = 17) and cysts (n = 8) had significantly lower HbT contrast than did the malignant lesions (P = .025 and P = .0033, respectively).ConclusionThe optical and DBT images were structurally consistent. The malignant tumors and benign lesions demonstrated different HbT and scattering contrasts, which can potentially be exploited to reduce the false-positive rate of conventional mammography and unnecessary biopsies.?

After the discovery in 1992 that the functional activation of the human cerebral cortex (due to oxygenation and hemodynamic changes) can be explored by NIRS, human functional brain mapping research has gained a new dimension. fNIRS or optical topography, or near-infrared imaging or diffuse optical imaging is used mainly to detect simultaneous changes in optical properties of the human cortex from multiple measurement sites and displays the results in the form of a map or image over a specific area. In order to place current fNIRS research in its proper context, this paper presents a brief historical overview of the events that have shaped the present status of fNIRS. In particular, technological progresses of fNIRS are highlighted (i.e. from single-site to multi-site functional cortical measurements (images)), introduction of the commercial multi-channel systems, recent commercial wireless instrumentation and more advanced prototypes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a noninvasive, nonionizing imaging modality that uses near-infrared light to visualize optically relevant chromophores. A recently developed dynamic DOT imaging system enables the study of hemodynamic effects in the breast during a breath-hold. Dynamic DOT imaging was performed in a total of 21 subjects (age 54±10  years) including 3 healthy subjects and 18 subjects with benign (n=8) and malignant (n=14) masses. Three-dimensional time-series images of the percentage change in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations ([HbO2] and [Hb]) from baseline are obtained over the course of a breath-hold. At a time point of 15 s following the end of the breath-hold, [Hb] in healthy breasts has returned to near-baseline values (1.6%±0.5%), while tumor-bearing breasts have increased levels of [Hb] (6.8%±3.6%, p<0.01). Further, healthy subjects have a higher correlation between the breasts over the course of the breath-hold as compared with the subjects with breast cancer (healthy: 0.96±0.02; benign: 0.89±0.02; malignant: 0.78±0.23, p<0.05). Therefore this study shows that dynamic features extracted from DOT measurements can differentiate healthy and diseased breast tissues. These features provide a physiologic method for identifying breast cancer without the need for ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional imaging in breast surgery has several uses clinically. The most practical applications are for the evaluation of breast asymmetries, both congenital and acquired, and for the evaluation of factors affecting breast shape in augmentation mammaplasty. Other uses of three-dimensional imaging that we have found clinically helpful are for evaluation of patients desiring reduction mammaplasty and for evaluation of patients undergoing unilateral breast reconstruction to determine the expander and permanent implant size that gives the best symmetry with the contralateral breast. We present five cases in which we investigate the use of three-dimensional imaging clinically by using the images to determine quantitative information about the breast, such as volume or projection. Overall, three-dimensional imaging is very helpful in providing objective information about the breast for use in preoperative planning. In addition, by analyzing clinical cases, it can provide objective data about the breast and surgical mammaplasty (especially augmentation mammaplasty) that may help surgeons better understand those factors that contribute to breast shape and influence surgical outcomes. There are currently some limitations of this system, influenced by patients with significant ptosis or obesity, which may introduce errors into the three-dimensional data, making them unreliable. However, we believe three-dimensional imaging has great clinical potential in surgical mammaplasty.},

The use of a PET/CT whole body imaging protocol may identify extended disease earlierthan conventional imaging methods and thus influence treatment decisions.},

abstract = {As new algorithms for microwave imaging emerge, it is important to have standard accurate benchmarking tests. Currently, most researchers use homogeneous phantoms for testing new algorithms. These simple structures lack the heterogeneity of the dielectric properties of human tissue and are inadequate for testing these algorithms for medical imaging. To adequately test breast microwave imaging algorithms, the phantom has to resemble different breast tissues physically and in terms of dielectric properties. We propose a systematic approach in designing phantoms that not only have dielectric properties close to breast tissues but also can be easily shaped to realistic physical models. The approach is based on regression model to match phantom's dielectric properties with the breast tissue dielectric properties found in Lazebnik et al. (2007). However, the methodology proposed here can be used to create phantoms for any tissue type as long as <italic>ex vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic>, or <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue dielectric properties are measured and available. Therefore, using this method, accurate benchmarking phantoms for testing emerging microwave imaging algorithms can be developed.},

A 32-channel time-resolved imaging system was employed, and data were acquired using custom-made helmets which couple source fibres and detector bundles to the infant head. Images have been reconstructed using measurements of mean flight time relative to those acquired on a homogeneous reference phantom, and using a head-shaped 3D finite-element-based forward model with an external boundary constrained to match the measured positions of the sources and detectors. Results are presented for a premature infant with a cerebral haemorrhage predominantly located within the left ventricle. Images representing the distribution of absorption at 780 nm and 815 nm reveal an asymmetry consistent with the haemorrhage, and corresponding maps of blood volume and fractional oxygen saturation are generally within expected physiological values.},

abstract = {A solid plastic phantom has been developed with optical properties that closely match those of human breast tissue at near-IR wavelengths. The phantom is a 54-mm-thick slab containing four small cylinders of contrasting scatter and absorption. A detailed description of the phantom is followed by an account of an attempt to image the phantom by a time-resolved imaging technique. Images generated with transmitted light with the shortest flight times revealed the embedded cylinders with greater visibility than images obtained with continuous light transillumination. However, images corresponding to flight times of less than $\sim$700 ps were severely degraded from a lack of detected photons. An attempt was made to overcome this degradation by extrapolating the measured temporal distributions with an analytic model of photon transport. Results suggest that subcentimeter resolution imaging of low-contrast tumors in the breast is scientifically possible. Our phantom is available to any other research groups wishing to evaluate their systems.},

According to BEIR VII data, these studies are associated, respectively, with LARs of fatal breast cancer of 1.3 and 1.7 cases per 100?000 women aged 40 years at exposure and less than one case per one million women aged 80 years at exposure. Annual screening digital or screen-film mammography performed in women aged 40?80 years is associated with an LAR of fatal breast cancer of 20?25 cases in 100?000. A single BSGI study involving a label-recommended dose of 740?1100 MBq (20?30 mCi) of technetium 99m?sestamibi is estimated to involve an LAR of fatal cancer that is 20?30 times that of digital mammography in women aged 40 years. A single PEM study involving a labeled dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose is estimated to involve an LAR of fatal cancer that is 23 times higher than that of digital mammography in women aged 40 years.ConclusionA single BSGI or PEM study is associated with a fatal radiation-induced cancer risk higher than or comparable to that of annual screening mammography in women aged 40?80 years.?

Cases were all the interval and screening-detected cancers from 35?127 FFDM and 52?444 SFM examinations in two Norwegian counties. Prior and diagnostic FFDM examinations of 49 interval and 86 screening-detected breast cancers were reviewed by four breast radiologists and compared with a review of SFM examinations of 81 interval and 123 screening-detected cancers. Cancers were classified as missed or true, mammographic features were described, percentages were compared by using the ?2 or Fisher exact test, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.ResultsThe percentages of interval and screening-detected cancers missed at FFDM and SFM did not differ significantly. (interval cancers missed: 33% [16 of 49] at FFDM vs 30% [24 of 81] at SFM [P = .868]; screening-detected cancers missed: 20% [17 of 86] at FFDM vs 21% [26 of 123] at SFM [P = .946]). Asymmetry was present in 27% (95% CI: 13.3%, 45.5%) of prior mammograms of cancers missed at FFDM and 10% (95% CI: 3.3%, 21.8%) of those missed at SFM (P = .070). Calcifications were observed in 18% (95% CI: 7.0%, 35.5%) of the cancers missed at FFDM and 34% (95% CI: 21.2%, 48.8%) of those missed at SFM (P = .185). Average mammographic tumor size of missed cancers manifesting as masses was 10.4 mm at FFDM and 13.6 mm at SFM (P = .036).ConclusionThe use of FFDM has not reduced the challenge of missed cancers.

abstract = {In this study, a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework for hybrid functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) for locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients is investigated. Brain tasks, channel selection methods, and feature extraction and classification algorithms available in the literature are reviewed. First, we categorize various types of patients with cognitive and motor impairments to assess the suitability of BCI for each of them. The prefrontal cortex is identified as a suitable brain region for imaging. Second, the brain activity that contributes to the generation of hemodynamic signals is reviewed. Mental arithmetic and word formation tasks are found to be suitable for use with LIS patients. Third, since a specific targeted brain region is needed for BCI, methods for determining the region of interest are reviewed. The combination of a bundled-optode configuration and threshold-integrated vector phase analysis turns out to be a promising solution. Fourth, the usable fNIRS features and EEG features are reviewed. For hybrid BCI, a combination of the signal peak and mean fNIRS signals and the highest band powers of EEG signals is promising. For classification, linear discriminant analysis has been most widely used. However, further research on vector phase analysis as a classifier for multiple commands is desirable. Overall, proper brain region identification and proper selection of features will improve classification accuracy. In conclusion, five future research issues are identified, and a new BCI scheme, including brain therapy for LIS patients and using the framework of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCI, is provided.},

abstract = {Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (DOT), one of the most sophisticated optical imaging techniques for observations through biological tissue, allows 3-D quantitative imaging of optical properties, which include functional and anatomical information. With DOT, it is expected to be possible to overcome the limitations of conventional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as well as offering the potential for diagnostic optical imaging. However, DOT has been under development for more than 30 years, and the difficulties in development are attributed to the fact that light is strongly scattered and that diffusive photons are used for the image reconstruction. The DOT algorithm is based on the techniques of inverse problems. The radiative transfer equation accurately describes photon propagation in biological tissue, while, because of its high computation load, the diffusion equation (DE) is often used as the forward model. However, the DE is invalid in low-scattering and/or highly absorbing regions and in the vicinity of light sources. The inverse problem is inherently ill-posed and highly undetermined. Here, we first summarize NIRS and then describe various approaches in the efforts to develop accurate and efficient DOT algorithms and present some examples of clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of DOT.},

abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

In order to capture the whole breast shape including the inframammary fold, the patients were introduced to the imaging room and leaned over the imaging rig to open up the inframammary fold and to expose the entire area of each breast. The imaging system consisted of eight high-resolution ((Formula presented.) pixels) digital cameras and four flash units. The cameras were arranged in four stereo pairs from four different view angles to cover the whole surface of the breasts. The system calibration was carried out ahead of every capture session, and the stereo images were matched to generate four range images to be integrated using an elastic model proposed. A watertight breast mesh model was reconstructed to measure the volume of the breast captured. The accuracy of using the developed multi-view stereophotogrammetry system for breast volume measurement was 11.12cc with SEM 7.74cc, comparing to the measurements of the water displacement method. It was concluded that the 3D stereophotogrammetry image system developed was more reliable than the method of water displacement.},

abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging modality is one of the widely used medical imaging techniques for breast cancer imaging, functional brain mapping, and many other applications. However, conventional NIR imaging systems are bulky and expensive, thereby limiting their accelerated clinical translation. Herein a new compact (6 × 7 × 12 cm3), cost-effective, and wide-field NIR scanner has been developed towards contact as well as no-contact based real-time imaging in both reflectance and transmission mode. The scanner mainly consists of an NIR source light (between 700- 900 nm), an NIR sensitive CCD camera, and a custom-developed image acquisition and processing software to image an area of 12 cm2. Phantom experiments have been conducted to estimate the feasibility of diffuse optical imaging by using Indian-Ink as absorption-based contrast agents. As a result, the developed NIR system measured the light intensity change in absorption-contrasted target up to 4 cm depth under transillumination mode. Preliminary in-vivo studies demonstrated the feasibility of real-time monitoring of blood flow changes. Currently, extensive in-vivo studies are carried out using the ultra-portable NIR scanner in order to assess the potential of the imager towards breast imaging.},

Matching between such pairs of images is considered essential by radiologists for more reliable diagnosis of early breast cancer. The two images are taken while the breast is compressed between the cassette and plate of the X-ray machine, but, almost always, to a different extent in each direction. The deformations of the breast caused by the different compressions in the different directions causes corresponding points to appear far from the straight 'epipolar lines' familiar from binocular stereo vision. The method developed in this paper calculates the line in a MLO image corresponding to a point in the CC image through simulation of the deformation and the projection of a 3D line(curve) corresponding to the point. Experiments using actual images show that the method gives good predictions which can be used to find exact correspondences between points in the two images.},

abstract = {Background: Breast volume is a relevant measure for the prevention and prediction of diseases and for aesthetic surgery. This study evaluated a new technique to determine breast volume and compared measures using a three-dimensional (3D) body surface scanner and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, with the latter used as the standard method. Methods: Both MRI scans and body surface 3D scans were obtained from 22 women. For each method, breast volumes were assessed. The MRI calculations of the breast volumes were performed by a specially trained radiologist using analysis software. A textured 3D image was generated by a calibrated digital texture camera after breast surface data acquisition. The volume assessment of the 3D photography was calculated using a software package after manual outlining of the breast and automated projection of a dorsal limit. Linear regression was used to predict the MRI volume assessment with the 3D image volume assessment. Results: The mean breast volume according to MRI volumetry was 442.8 ml on the left side and 471.8 ml on the right side. The mean breast volume using a 3D body surface volume assessment method was 273.8 ml (observer A) and 226.2 ml (observer B) on the left side and 284.4 ml (observer A) and 234.9 ml (observer B) on the right side. The use of linear regression models showed R 2 values of 0.59-0.77. The mean time for MRI recording and volume assessment was 68.0 ± 14.1 min for both sides and 11.6 ± 1.5 min for 3D recording and volume assessment. Conclusions: The 3D surface-based volume measurements are feasible in terms of time and can predict the MRI breast volume with sufficient accuracy. This might facilitate the broad use of such an assessment technique in a large-scale epidemiologic study using breast volume as a study aim. Additionally, further development of volume assessments could help to implement this technique in breast surgery procedures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.},

We present an in vivo characterization performed on seventeen healthy subjects at six different superficial bone locations: radius distal, radius proximal, ulna distal, ulna proximal, trochanter and calcaneus. A tailored diffuse optical protocol for high penetration depth combined with the rather superficial nature of considered tissues ensured the effective probing of the bone tissue. Measurements were performed using a broadband system for Time-Resolved Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy (TRS) to assess mean absorption and reduced scattering spectra in the 600-1200 nm range and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) to monitor microvascular blood flow. Significant variations among tissue constituents were found between different locations; with radius distal rich of collagen, suggesting it as a prominent location for bone related measurements, and calcaneus bone having highest blood flow among the body locations being considered. By using TRS and DCS together, we are able to probe the perfusion and oxygen consumption of the tissue without any contrast agents. Therefore, we predict that these methods will be able to evaluate the impairment of the oxygen metabolism of the bone at the point-of-care.},

abstract = {Quantification of the complex breast region can be helpful in breast surgery, which is shaped by subjective influences. However, there is no generally recognized method for breast volume calculation. Three-dimensional (3D) body surface imaging represents a new alternative for breast volume computation. The aim of this work was to compare breast volume calculation with 3D scanning and three classic methods, focusing on relative advantages, disadvantages, and reproducibility. Repeated breast volume calculations of both breasts in six patients (n=12) were performed using a 3D laser scanner, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thermoplastic castings, and anthropomorphic measurements. Mean volumes (cc) and mean measurement deviations were calculated, and regression analyses were performed. MRI showed the highest measurement precision, with a mean deviation (expressed as a percentage of mean breast volume) of 1.56±0.52% compared with 2.27±0.99% for the 3D scanner, 7.97±3.53% for thermoplastic castings, and 6.26±1.56% for the anthropomorphic measurements. Breast volume calculations using MRI showed the best agreement with 3D scanning measurement (r=0.990), followed by anthropomorphic measurement (r=0.947), and thermoplastic castings (r=0.727). Compared with three classical methods of breast volume calculation, 3D scanning provides acceptable accuracy for breast volume measurements, better spatial interpretation of the anatomical area to be operated on (due to lack of chest deformation), non-invasiveness, and good patient tolerance. After this preliminary study and further development, we believe that 3D body surface scanning could provide better preoperative planning and postoperative control in everyday clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract: Precise and objective calculation of breast volume is helpful to evaluate the aesthetic result of breast surgery, but traditional methods are unsatisfactory. Three-dimensional (3D) scanning of the body surface allows reproducible and objective assessment of the complex breast region but requires further investigation before clinical application. The main goal of this study was to investigate the precision and accuracy of breast volume measurement using 3D body scanning. Five independent observers standardized the 3D scanning method using 2 dummy models (n = 200) and examined its applicability with 6 test subjects and 10 clinical patients (n = 2220). Breast volume measurements obtained with the 3D-scanner technology were compared with reference measurements obtained from test subjects through nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The mean deviation of the breast volume measurements of 1 test subject by all observers, expressed as percentage of volume, was 2.86 ± 0.98, significantly higher than the deviation for the dummy models, 1.65 ± 0.42 (P < 0.001). With respect to all clinical patients, the mean measurement precision obtained preoperatively was less precise than that obtained postoperatively (3.31 ± 1.02 versus 1.66 ± 0.49, respectively). Interobserver differences in measurement precision were not statistically significant. The mean breast volumes obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (441.42 ± 137.05 mL) and 3D scanning (452.51 ± 141.88 mL) significantly correlated (r = 0.995, P < 0.001). Breast volume measurement with 3D surface imaging represents a sufficiently precise and accurate method to guarantee objective and exact recording.},

abstract = {A Near Infrared Spectral Tomography (NIRST) system has been developed and integrated into a commercial Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) scanner to allow structural and functional imaging of breast in vivo. The NIRST instrument uses an 8-wavelength continuous wave (CW) laserbased scanning source assembly and a 75-element silicon photodiode solidstate detector panel to produce dense spectral and spatial projection data from which spectrally constrained 3D tomographic images of tissue chromophores are produced. Integration of the optical imaging system into the DBT scanner allows direct co-registration of the optical and DBT imageswhile also facilitating the synergistic use of x-ray contrast as anatomical priors in optical image reconstruction. Currentlythe total scan time for a combined NIRST-DBT exam is ∼50s with data collection from 8 wavelengths in the optical scan requiring ∼42s to complete. The system was tested in breast simulating phantoms constructed using intralipid and blood in an agarose matrix with a 3 cm x 2 cm cylindrical inclusion at 1 cm depth from the surface. Diffuse image reconstruction of total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration resulted in accurate recovery of the lateral size and position of the inclusion to within 6% and 8%respectively. Use of DBT structural priors in the NIRST reconstruction process improved the quantitative accuracy of the HbT recoveryand led to linear changes in imaged versus actual contrastunderscoring the advantages of dual-modality optical imaging approaches. The quantitative accuracy of the system can be further improved with independent measurements of scattering properties through integration of frequency or time domain data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The analysis of 2D mammographic images can be difficult due to the projective nature of the imaging technique and poor contrast between tumorous and healthy fibro-glandular tissue. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can overcome these disadvantages by providing a 3D dataset of the breast. The detection of corresponding image structures is challenging due to large breast deformations during the image acquisition. We present a method for analyzing 2D/3D intra-individual correspondences between mammography and MRI datasets. Therefore, an ICP-based B-spline registration is used to approximate the breast deformation differences. The resulting deformed MR image is projected onto the 2D plane to enable a comparison with the 2D mammogram. A first evaluation based on six mammograms revealed an average accuracy of 4.87 mm. In contrast to previous FEM-based approaches, we propose a fast and easy to implement 3D/3D-registration, for simulating the mammographic breast compression. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate a dedicated setup for ultrahigh resolution MR imaging of the human finger in vivo. METHODS: A radiofrequency coil was designed for optimized signal homogeneity and sensitivity in the finger at ultrahigh magnetic field strength (7 T), providing high measurement sensitivity. Imaging sequences (2D turbo-spin echo (TSE) and 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE)) were adapted for high spatial resolution and good contrast of different tissues in the finger, while keeping acquisition time below 10 minutes. Data was postprocessed to display finger structures in three dimensions. RESULTS: 3D MPRAGE data with isotropic resolution of 200 µm, along with 2D TSE images with in-plane resolutions of 58 × 78 µm(2) and 100 × 97 µm(2) , allowed clear identification of various anatomical features such as bone and bone marrow, tendons and annular ligaments, cartilage, arteries and veins, nerves, and Pacinian corpuscles. CONCLUSION: Using this dedicated finger coil at 7 T, together with adapted acquisition sequences, it is possible to depict the internal structures of the human finger in vivo within patient-compatible measurement time. It may serve as a tool for diagnosis and treatment monitoring in pathologies ranging from inflammatory or erosive joint diseases to injuries of tendons and ligaments to nervous or vascular disorders in the finger.

Diffuse Optical Imaging using harmless near infra red light, provides lesion detection based on functional abnormalities and represents a novel diagnostic arm that could complement traditional mammography. Reviews of optical breast imaging have not been systematic, are focused mainly on technological developments, and have become superseded by rapid technological advancement. The aim of this study is to review clinically orientated studies involving approximately 2,000 women in whom optical mammography has been used to evaluate the healthy or diseased breast. The results suggest that approximately 85% of breast lesions are detectable on optical mammography. Spectroscopic resolution of tissue haemoglobin composition and oxygen saturation may improve the detectability of breast diseases. Results suggest that breast lesions contain approximately twice the haemoglobin concentration of background tissue. Current evidence suggests that it is not possible to distinguish benign from malignant disease using optical imaging techniques in isolation. Methods to improve the performance of Diffuse Optical Imaging, such as better spectral coverage with additional wavelengths, improved modelling of light transport in tissues and the use of extrinsic dyes may augment lesion detection and characterisation. Future research should involve large clinical trials to determine the overall sensitivity and specificity of optical imaging techniques as well as to establish patient satisfaction and economic viability.},

These social skills are largely learned within the context of day-to-day interactions with caregivers. While social neuroscience has made great gains in our knowledge of the underlying neural circuitry of social cognition and behavior, much of this work has focused on experiments that sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising methodology for measuring brain activity in the context of naturalistic social interactions. Here, we review what we have learned from fNIRS studies that have used traditional experimental stimuli to study social development during infancy. We then discuss recent infant fNIRS studies that have utilized more naturalistic social stimuli, followed by a discussion of applications of this methodology to the study of atypical social development, with a focus on infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder. We end with recommendations for applying fNIRS to studies of typically developing and at-risk infants in naturalistic social situations.},

abstract = {Structured-light systems are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.},

abstract = {Clinical applications of three-dimensional digital photography include assessments of breast volume and contour. It was hypothesized that knowledge of preoperative and postoperative breast volumes might facilitate obtaining symmetry after reconstructions with autologous tissue or implants. Breast reconstruction was performed for 382 women during a 4-year period. Of those women, 334 completed all phases of the reconstruction and underwent symmetry analysis. Reconstructive procedures included the use of pedicle transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flaps, free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flaps, deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps, superior gluteal artery perforator flaps, or latissimus dorsi flaps or expanders/implants. Three-dimensional digital photographic images were obtained for 33 women, whereas the remaining 301 women were not digitally photographed. The differences in symmetry after the initial reconstruction and after the secondary procedures were compared for all women and for the groups with and without three-dimensional photographic images. For the group with three-dimensional imaging, initial volume symmetry was obtained for 73 percent, initial contour symmetry was obtained for 27 percent, secondary procedures were necessary for 70 percent, final volume symmetry was obtained for 88 percent, and final contour symmetry was obtained for 79 percent. For the group without three-dimensional photographic images, initial volume symmetry was obtained for 57 percent, initial contour symmetry was obtained for 34 percent, secondary procedures were necessary for 50 percent, final volume symmetry was obtained for 80 percent, and final contour symmetry was obtained for 71 percent. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in final contour and volume symmetry between women who had or did not have three-dimensional digital photographic images taken. However, the results demonstrated that autologous tissue reconstructions resulted in improved contour and volume symmetry, compared with implant reconstructions.},

abstract = {? 2015 Naseer and Hong.A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that allows the use of brain activity to control computers or other external devices. It can, by bypassing the peripheral nervous system, provide a means of communication for people suffering from severe motor disabilities or in a persistent vegetative state. In this paper, brain-signal generation tasks, noise removal methods, feature extraction/selection schemes, and classification techniques for fNIRS-based BCI are reviewed. The most common brain areas for fNIRS BCI are the primary motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex. In relation to the motor cortex, motor imagery tasks were preferred to motor execution tasks since possible proprioceptive feedback could be avoided. In relation to the prefrontal cortex, fNIRS showed a significant advantage due to no hair in detecting the cognitive tasks like mental arithmetic, music imagery, emotion induction, etc. In removing physiological noise in fNIRS data, band-pass filtering was mostly used. However, more advanced techniques like adaptive filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), multi optodes arrangement, etc. are being pursued to overcome the problem that a band-pass filter cannot be used when both brain and physiological signals occur within a close band. In extracting features related to the desired brain signal, the mean, variance, peak value, slope, skewness, and kurtosis of the noised-removed hemodynamic response were used. For classification, the linear discriminant analysis method provided simple but good performance among others: support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), artificial neural network, etc. fNIRS will be more widely used to monitor the occurrence of neuro-plasticity after neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-stimulation. Technical breakthroughs in the future are expected via bundled-type probes, hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI, and through the detection of initial dips.},

abstract = {It is important for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and imaging to estimate the sensitivity of the detected signal to the change in hemoglobin that results from brain activation and the volume of tissue interrogated for a specific source-detector fiber spacing. In this study light propagation in adult head models is predicted by Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the effect of the superficial tissue thickness on the partial optical path length in the brain and on the spatial sensitivity profile. In the case of source-detector spacing of 30 mm, the partial optical path length depends mainly on the depth of the inner skull surface whereas the spatial sensitivity profile is significantly affected by the thickness of the cerebrospinal fluid layer. The mean optical path length that can be measured by time-resolved experiments increases when the skull thickness increases whereas the partial mean optical path length in the brain decreases when the skull thickness increases. These results indicate that it is not appropriate to use the mean optical path length as an alternative to the partial optical path length to compensate the NIRS signal for the difference in sensitivity caused by variation of the superficial tissue thickness.},

abstract = {Purpose: Breast density is considered a significant risk factor and an important biomarker influencing the later risk of breast cancer. Prior breast segmentation is required when quantifying breast density with MRI in order to calculate the total breast volume and exclude nonbreast surrounding tissues. This paper describes an automatic 3D breast volume segmentation approach. Methods: The method is based on 3D local edge detection using phase congruency and Poisson surface reconstruction to extract the total breast volume. The boundary localization framework is integrated to a subsequent shape atlas-based segmentation using a Laplacian framework. Results: The 3D segmentation achieves breast-air and breast-chest wall boundary localization errors with a median of 1.36 mm and 2.68 mm, respectively, and an average volume error of 153.8 cm 3 when tested on 409 MRI datasets. Furthermore, the breast volume assessment technique will produce a 5.3 variability in the estimation of breast density in the tested population. Conclusions: The fully automated segmentation approach of the breast in MRI allows the computation of total breast volume, a step required for breast density assessment. The use of features invariant to image intensity and a shape atlas to reinforce shape consistency are attractive characteristics of the method. Error analysis demonstrates that 5.3 variability in the estimation of breast density incurred by the method is an acceptable trade-off. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Background: Wire localization for excision of nonpalpable breast cancer is an inefficient and inexact technique. Methods: A total of 18 women with palpable invasive breast cancers underwent preoperative prone and supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraoperatively, the edges of the tumor were palpated and marked on the skin surface. The breast was optically scanned, and the supine MRI was adjusted to match the actual breast position at the time of surgery. Image-defined tumor edges were marked on the surface of the breast. The main outcome measure was the distance between the image-defined and palpation-defined edges of the tumor. Results: No significant difference was found between the mean maximal tumor diameter as measured by histopathology (29.6 ± 14.3 mm), supine MRI (25.3 ± 9.7 mm), prone MRI (27.6 ± 13 mm), or palpation (30.5 ± 9.3 mm). The distance from the tumor to the chest wall was markedly different in prone versus supine MRI (56.4 ± 38 vs 19.5 ± 20 mm, p =.002). The average distance between the palpated and supine MRI image-defined tumor edge locations was 7.2 mm (range, 0-19 mm). Accuracy improved over time; the average difference in edge locations in the last 7 patients was 4.0 mm. All 4 image-defined edge locations in the last 5 patients were ≤1 cm away from the palpated locations. Conclusions: We have developed a method of breast tumor localization using preoperative supine MRI and intraoperative optical scanning that defines tumor size and position as accurately as palpation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

abstract = {The assessment of physiological changes associated with brain activity has become possible by optical methods, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS is a useful neuroimaging technique based on haemodynamic principles for the non-invasive investigation of brain in motion. Due to its properties, the near-infrared light can penetrate biological tissue reasonably well to assess brain activity and two types of measurements are possible according to the number of channels used: dynamic changes in a localized brain region or functional brain imaging. The theoretical and technological advances of the past 10–15 years have opened the door to a range of applications in the human movement sciences, including some that involve imaging of the adult brain during motor and cognitive tasks, which for many years had been inaccessible to NIRS. This article examines the perturbation methods for measuring cerebral haemodynamic responses within resting and exercise conditions in humans and how NIRS can be used to image the moving brain. Methodological challenges of NIRS technique are presented, while the advantages and pitfalls of NIRS compared to other neuroimaging methods are discussed. Actual and future uses for NIRS in the field of sport sciences are outlined for a better understanding of brain processes during movement.},

This fast growth is due to the several advances that fNIRS offers over the other neuroimaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography. In particular, fNIRS is harmless, tolerant to bodily movements, and highly portable, being suitable for all possible participant populations, from newborns to the elderly and experimental settings, both inside and outside the laboratory. In this review we aim to provide a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of fNIRS basics, technical developments, and applications. In particular, we discuss some of the open challenges and the potential of fNIRS for cognitive neuroscience research, with a particular focus on neuroimaging in naturalistic environments and social cognitive neuroscience.},

abstract = {This article is based on an introductory lecture given for the past many years during the "MR Physics and Techniques for Clinicians" course at the Annual Meeting of the ISMRM. This introduction is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the field, as the subject of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physics is large and complex. Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.},

abstract = {Many modern sensors used for mapping produce 3D point clouds, which are typically registered together using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Because ICP has many variants whose performances depend on the environment and the sensor, hundreds of variations have been published. However, no comparison frameworks are available, leading to an arduous selection of an appropriate variant for particular experimental conditions. The first contribution of this paper consists of a protocol that allows for a comparison between ICP variants, taking into account a broad range of inputs. The second contribution is an open-source ICP library, which is fast enough to be usable in multiple real-world applications, while being modular enough to ease comparison of multiple solutions. This paper presents two examples of these field applications. The last contribution is the comparison of two baseline ICP variants using data sets that cover a rich variety of environments. Besides demonstrating the need for improved ICP methods for natural, unstructured and information-deprived environments, these baseline variants also provide a solid basis to which novel solutions could be compared. The combination of our protocol, software, and baseline results demonstrate convincingly how open-source software can push forward the research in mapping and navigation.},

abstract = {To characterize and develop a patient-based 3D model of the compressed breast undergoing mammography and breast tomosynthesis. During this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 50 women were recruited to undergo 3D breast surface imaging with structured light (SL) during breast compression, along with simultaneous acquisition of a tomosynthesis image. A pair of SL systems were used to acquire 3D surface images by projecting 24 different patterns onto the compressed breast and capturing their reflection off the breast surface in approximately 12-16 s. The 3D surface was characterized and modeled via principal component analysis. The resulting surface model was combined with a previously developed 2D model of projected compressed breast shapes to generate a full 3D model. Data from ten patients were discarded due to technical problems during image acquisition. The maximum breast thickness (found at the chest-wall) had an average value of 56 mm, and decreased 13% towards the nipple (breast tilt angle of 5.2°). The portion of the breast not in contact with the compression paddle or the support table extended on average 17 mm, 18% of the chest-wall to nipple distance. The outermost point along the breast surface lies below the midline of the total thickness. A complete 3D model of compressed breast shapes was created and implemented as a software application available for download, capable of generating new random realistic 3D shapes of breasts undergoing compression. Accurate characterization and modeling of the breast curvature and shape was achieved and will be used for various image processing and clinical tasks.},

The methodology detects oxygenation changes elicited by functional activation of the cerebral cortex. The main advantages for research on auditory language processing and its development during infancy are an undemanding application, the lack of instrumental noise, and its potential to simultaneously register electrophysiological responses. Also it constitutes an innovative approach for studying developmental issues in infants and children.

Sophisticated interpretation methods operating on these representations eliminate noise and resample the data without deleting the important details, and interpret the improved point clouds in terms of rectangular planes and 3D geometric shapes. We detail the steps of our mapping approach and explain the key techniques that make it work.

As the vast majority of commercial instruments developed until now are based on continuous wave technology, the aim of this publication is to review the current state of instrumentation and methodology of continuous wave fNIRI. For this purpose we provide an overview of the commercially available instruments and address instrumental aspects such as light sources, detectors and sensor arrangements. Methodological aspects, algorithms to calculate the concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and approaches for data analysis are also reviewed.From the single-location measurements of the early years, instrumentation has progressed to imaging initially in two dimensions (topography) and then three (tomography). The methods of analysis have also changed tremendously, from the simple modified Beer-Lambert law to sophisticated image reconstruction and data analysis methods used today. Due to these advances, fNIRI has become a modality that is widely used in neuroscience research and several manufacturers provide commercial instrumentation. It seems likely that fNIRI will become a clinical tool in the foreseeable future, which will enable diagnosis in single subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Image reconstruction in optical tomography is a nonlinear and generally ill-posed inverse problem. Noise in the measured surface data can give rise to substantial artifacts in the recovered volume images of optical coefficients.Apart from random shot noise caused by the limited number of photons detected at the measurement site, another class of systematic noise is associated with losses specific to individual source and detector locations. A common cause for such losses in data acquisition systems based on fiber-optic light delivery is the imperfect coupling between the fiber tips and the skin of the patient because of air gaps or surface moisture. Thus the term coupling errors was coined for this type of data noise. However, source and detector specific errors can also occur in noncontact measurement systems not using fiber-optic delivery, for example, owing to local skin pigmentation, hair and hair follicles, or instrumentation calibration errors.Often it is not possible to quantify coupling effects in a way that allows us to remove them from the data or incorporate them into the light transport model.We present an alternative method of eliminating coupling errors by regarding the complex-valued coupling factors for each source and detector as unknowns in the reconstruction process and recovering them simultaneously with the images of absorption and scattering. Our method takes into account the possibility that coupling effects have an influence on both the amplitude and the phase shift of the measurements.Reconstructions from simulated and experimental phantom data are presented, which show that including the coupling coefficients in the reconstruction greatly improves the recovery of absorption and scatteringimages.},

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

abstract = {Abstract The current paradigm of breast cancer management may be altered significantly over the coming years by the adoption of new treatment schema and devices outside of the surgical arena. New advances in breast cancer imaging will improve our ability to detect early-stage disease but also will assist in monitoring treatment outcomes and support the development of nonsurgical ablation techniques. These advances, some already in use, include a 3-dimensional adaptation of digital mammography, color Doppler ultrasonography that can visualize neovascularization in growing tumors, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with improved accuracy for the detection of occult cancers, a specialized approach to positron emission tomography designed for use on the breast, and the development of nanoparticle contrast agents that can be visualized with near-infrared light. Systemic therapy, which revolutionized breast cancer management in the last half of the 20th century, is being reconceptualized, with attention turning to adjusting the timing of chemotherapy. Dose-dense regimens are being tested, and there also is interest in so-called metronomic chemotherapy in which very low doses are given on a very frequent schedule, resulting in reduced toxicity and treatment outcomes that reflect an antiangiogenic mode of action. Finally, the possibility of a breast cancer vaccine continues to intrigue and excite physicians and patients alike, with the promise of enlisting the body's own immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells and/or prevent the development of future disease. It will be important for surgeons to stay aware of all developments that may improve the care of their patients and to be true surgical oncologists rather than merely surgical technicians.

The authors performed a preplanned interim analysis of results from 12631 examinations interpreted by using mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis from November 22, 2010, to December 31, 2011. Analyses were based on marginal log-linear models for binary data, accounting for correlated interpretations and adjusting for reader-specific performance levels by using a two-sided significance level of .0294.ResultsDetection rates, including those for invasive and in situ cancers, were 6.1 per 1000 examinations for mammography alone and 8.0 per 1000 examinations for mammography plus tomosynthesis (27% increase, adjusted for reader; P = .001). False-positive rates before arbitration were 61.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography alone and 53.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography plus tomosynthesis (15% decrease, adjusted for reader; P < .001). After arbitration, positive predictive values for recalled patients with cancers verified later were comparable (29.1% and 28.5%, respectively, with mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis; P = .72). Twenty-five additional invasive cancers were detected with mammography plus tomosynthesis (40% increase, adjusted for reader; P < .001). The mean interpretation time was 45 seconds for mammography alone and 91 seconds for mammography plus tomosynthesis (P < .001).ConclusionThe use of mammography plus tomosynthesis in a screening environment resulted in a significantly higher cancer detection rate and enabled the detection of more invasive cancers.?RSNA, 2013Clinical trial registration no.

In this review, we aim to highlight the application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a useful neuroimaging technique for the investigation of cognitive development. We focus on brain activation changes during the development of mathematics and language skills in schoolchildren. We discuss how technical limitations of common neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have resulted in our limited understanding of neural changes during development, while fNIRS would be a suitable and child-friendly method to examine cognitive development. Moreover, this technique enables us to go to schools to collect large samples of data from children in ecologically valid settings. Furthermore, we report findings of fNIRS studies in the fields of mathematics and language, followed by a discussion of the outlook of fNIRS in these fields. We suggest fNIRS as an additional technique to track brain activation changes in the field of educational neuroscience.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatial and depth sensitivity of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to brain tissue-i.e., near-infrared neuromonitoring (NIN) - is essential for designing experiments as well as interpreting research findings. However, a thorough characterization of such sensitivity in realistic head models has remained unavailable. In this study, we conducted 3,555 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to densely cover the scalp of a well-characterized, adult male template brain (Colin27). We sought to evaluate: (i) the spatial sensitivity profile of NIRS to brain tissue as a function of source-detector separation, (ii) the NIRS sensitivity to brain tissue as a function of depth in this realistic and complex head model, and (iii) the effect of NIRS instrument sensitivity on detecting brain activation. We found that increasing the source-detector (SD) separation from 20 to 65 mm provides monotonic increases in sensitivity to brain tissue. For every 10 mm increase in SD separation (up to $\sim$45 mm), sensitivity to gray matter increased an additional 4%. Our analyses also demonstrate that sensitivity in depth (S) decreases exponentially, with a "rule-of-thumb" formula S=0.75*0.85(depth). Thus, while the depth sensitivity of NIRS is not strictly limited, NIN signals in adult humans are strongly biased towards the outermost 10-15 mm of intracranial space. These general results, along with the detailed quantitation of sensitivity estimates around the head, can provide detailed guidance for interpreting the likely sources of NIRS signals, as well as help NIRS investigators design and plan better NIRS experiments, head probes and instruments.},

We aimed to assess the long-term effect of mammographic screening on death from breast cancer, taking into account potential biases from self-selection, changes in breast cancer incidence, and classification of cause of death. Methods: We compared deaths from breast cancer diagnosed in the 20 years before screening was introduced (1958-77) with those from breast cancer diagnosed in the 20 years after the introduction of screening (1978-97) in two Swedish counties, in 210 000 women aged 20-69 years. We also compared deaths from all cancers and from all causes in patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the 20 years before and after screening was introduced. In the analysis, data were stratified into age-groups invited for screening (40-69 years) and not invited (20-39 years), and by whether or not the women had actually received screening. We also analysed mortality for the 40-49-year age-group separately. Findings: The unadjusted risk of death from breast cancer dropped significantly in the second screening period compared with the first in women aged 40-69 years (relative risk [RR] 0.77 [95% CI 0.7-0.85]; p<0.0001). No such decline was seen in 20-39 year olds. After adjustment for age, self-selection bias, and changes in breast-cancer incidence in the 40-69 years age-group, breast-cancer mortality was reduced in women who were screened (0.56; 0.49-0.64 p<0.0001), in those who were not screened (0.84 [0.71-0.99]; p=0.03), and in screened and unscreened women combined (0.59 [0.53-0.66]; p<0.0001). After adjustment for age, self-selection bias, and changes in incidence in the 40-49-year age-group, deaths from breast cancer fell significantly in those who were screened (0.52 [0.4-0.67]; p<0.0001); and in all women, screened and unscreened combined (0.55 [0.44-0.7] p<0.0001) but not in unscreened women (p=0.2). In both 40-69-year and 40-49-year age-groups, reductions in deaths from all cancers and from all-causes in women with breast cancer were consistent with these results. Interpretation Taking account of potential biases, changes in clinical practice and changes in the incidence of breast cancer, mammography screening is contributing to substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality in these two Swedish counties.},

abstract = {The first time-resolved optical mammograph operating beyond 900 nm was tested in a retrospective clinical study involving 194 patients with malignant and benign lesions, to investigate the diagnostic potential for the detection and characterization of breast lesions. For the first part of the study (101 patients with 114 lesions), the system was operated at 683, 785, 913 and 975 nm. Subsequently, to improve the spectral content of optical images, the number of wavelengths was increased (up to 7) and the spectral range was extended (637-985 nm). Late gated intensity and scattering images provide sensitivity to tissue composition (oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin, water and lipids) and physiology (total haemoglobin content and oxygen saturation), as well as to structural changes. Tumours are typically identified because of the strong blood absorption at short wavelengths (637-685 nm), while cysts are characterized by low scattering, leading to a detection rate of approximately 80% for both lesion types, when detection is required in both cranio-caudal and oblique views. The detection rate for other benign lesions, such as fibroadenomas, is presently much lower (<40%). The effectiveness of the technique in localizing and identifying different lesion types was analysed as a function of various parameters (lesion size, compressed breast thickness, age, body mass index, breast parenchymal pattern). The possibility that physiologic changes due to the development of a malignant lesion could affect the entire breast was investigated. The capacity to assess the density of breast based on the average scattering properties was also tested.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast shape is largely determined by the volume of tissue and surface area of the skin envelope. Values for breast surface area have never been published in the literature. The investigators have developed an inexpensive, noninvasive optical method to objectively measure breast volume and surface area, and its accuracy is determined. METHODS: An optical grid is projected onto the breast, and two images are captured to create a computerized three-dimensional model from which volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection are calculated. RESULTS: To assess accuracy, simple geometric shapes (n = 22) were analyzed, and the actual volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were compared with the imaged values using least-squares linear regression. There was excellent correlation in all three parameters (r  >  0.995, p  <  10). The mean differences in volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were 28 ± 28 ml (mean ± SD), 2 ± 9 cm, and 0.4 ± 0.5 cm, respectively. Female breasts (n = 14) were then analyzed, and the actual volume and surface area were measured using plaster casts. Based on least-squares linear regression, there was excellent correlation between the imaged values and actual values (r  >  0.992, p  <  10), and the mean differences in volume and surface area were 32 ± 22 ml and 3 ± 11 cm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, an optical method has been demonstrated to measure volume and surface area with accuracy. When the method is applied to the breast, measurement errors are small and clinically insignificant. The ability to facilitate quantitative breast surgery will be investigated in future phases of this experiment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

NIR in vivo spectroscopy enables to derive the concentration of the key tissue constituents absorbing in the 600-1100 nm range, that is oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, water and lipids. Yet, although the first three constituents are already well characterized in literature, quite few data are available on mammalian lipids. In the present proceeding we report the absorption spectrum of a clear purified oil obtained from pig lard. Absorption coefficients were measured with time- and spatially resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques. At temperatures of 37°C and higher it is a clear transparent liquid thus suitable for collimated transmission measurements. In total three independent measurement techniques were employed to determine the absorption coefficients of mammalian lipids.},

Optical measurements during brain activation can assess haemoglobin oxygenation, cytochrome-c-oxidase redox state, and two types of changes in light scattering reflecting either membrane potential (fast signal) or cell swelling (slow signal), respectively. In previous studies of exposed brain tissue, optical imaging of brain activity has been achieved at high temporal and microscopical spatial resolution. Now, using near-infrared light that can penetrate biological tissue reasonably well, it has become possible to assess brain activity in human subjects through the intact skull non-invasively. After early studies employing single-site near-infrared spectroscopy, first near-infrared imaging devices are being applied successfully for low-resolution functional brain imaging. Advantages of the optical methods include biochemical specificity, a temporal resolution in the millisecond range, the potential of measuring intracellular and intravascular events simultaneously and the portability of the devices enabling bedside examinations.},

abstract = {To facilitate the clinical applicability of the diffuse optical inspection device, a compact multi-wavelength diffuse optical tomography system for breast imaging (compact-DOTB) with a fiber-free parallel-plane structure was designed and fabricated for acquiring three-dimensional optical properties of the breast in continuous-wave mode. The source array consists of 56 surface-mounted micro light-emitting diodes (LEDs), each integrating three wavelengths (660, 750, and 840 nm). The detector array is arranged with 56 miniaturized surface-mounted optical sensors, each encapsulating a high-sensitivity photodiode (PD) and a low-noise current amplifier with a gain of 24×. The system provides 3,136 pairs of source-detector measurements at each wavelength, and the fiber-free design largely ensures consistency between source/detection channels while effectively reducing the complexity of system operation and maintenance. We have evaluated the compact-DOTB system's characteristics and demonstrated its performance in terms of reconstruction positioning accuracy and recovery contrast with breast-sized phantom experiments. Furthermore, the breast cancer patient studies have been carried out, and the quantitative results indicate that the compact-DOTB system is able to observe the changes in the functional tissue components of the breast after receiving the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), demonstrating the great potential of the proposed compact system for clinical applications, while its cost and ease of operation are competitive with the existing breast-DOT devices.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound may improve the ability to detect breast cancer at an early stage.ObjectiveTo compare the sensitivity and specificity of 4 methods of breast cancer surveillance (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and CBE) in women with hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA surveillance study of 236 Canadian women aged 25 to 65 years with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who underwent 1 to 3 annual screening examinations, consisting of MRI, mammography, and ultrasound at a single tertiary care teaching hospital between November 3, 1997, and March 31, 2003. On the day of imaging and at 6-month intervals, CBE was performed.Main Outcome MeasuresSensitivity and specificity of each of the 4 surveillance modalities, and sensitivity of all 4 screening modalities vs mammography and CBE.ResultsEach imaging modality was read independently by a radiologist and scored on a 5-point Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scale. All lesions with a score of 4 or 5 (suspicious or highly suspicious for malignancy) were biopsied. There were 22 cancers detected (16 invasive and 6 ductal carcinoma in situ). Of these, 17 (77%) were detected by MRI vs 8 (36%) by mammography, 7 (33%) by ultrasound, and 2 (9.1%) by CBE. The sensitivity and specificity (based on biopsy rates) were 77% and 95.4% for MRI, 36% and 99.8% for mammography, 33% and 96% for ultrasound, and 9.1% and 99.3% for CBE, respectively. There was 1 interval cancer. All 4 screening modalities combined had a sensitivity of 95% vs 45% for mammography and CBE combined.ConclusionsIn BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, MRI is more sensitive for detecting breast cancers than mammography, ultrasound, or CBE alone. Whether surveillance regimens that include MRI will reduce mortality from breast cancer in high-risk women requires further investigation.},

abstract = {Background. Neonatal infections are a major cause of death worldwide. Simple procedures for identifying infants with infection that need referral for treatment are therefore of major public health importance. Methods. We investigated 3303 infants <2 months of age presenting with illness to health facilities in Ethiopia, The Gambia, Papua New Guinea and The Philippines, using a standardized approach. Historical factors and clinical signs predicting sepsis, meningitis, hypoxemia, deaths and an ordinal scale indicating severe disease were investigated by logistic regression, and the performance of simple combination rules was explored. Results. In multivariable analysis, reduced feeding ability, no spontaneous movement, temperature >38°C, being drowsy/unconscious, a history of a feeding problem, history of change in activity, being agitated, the presence of lower chest wall indrawing, respiratory rate >60 breaths/min, grunting, cyanosis, a history of convulsions, a bulging fontanel and slow digital capillary refill were independent predictors of severe disease. The presence of any 1 of these 14 signs had a sensitivity for severe disease (defined as sepsis, meningitis, hypoxemia, or radiologically proven pneumonia) of 87% and a specificity of 54%. More stringent combinations, such as demanding 2 signs from the list, resulted in a considerable loss of sensitivity. By contrast only slight loss of sensitivity and considerable gain of specificity resulted from reducing the list to 9 signs. Requiring the presence of fever and any other sign produced a diagnostic rule with extremely low sensitivity (25%). Conclusions. Physical signs can be used to identify young infants at risk of severe disease, however with limited specificity, resulting in large numbers of unnecessary referrals. Further studies are required to validate and refine the prediction of severe disease, especially in the first week of life, but there appear to be limits on the accuracy of prediction that is achievable.},

abstract = {Modeling 3D objects and scenes is an important part of computer graphics. One approach to modeling is projecting binary patterns onto the scene in order to obtain correspondences and reconstruct a densely sampled 3D model. In such structured light systems, determining whether a pixel is directly illuminated by the projector is essential to decoding the patterns. In this paper, we introduce a robust, efficient, and easy to implement pixel classification algorithm for this purpose. Our method correctly establishes the lower and upper bounds of the possible intensity values of an illuminated pixel and of a non-illuminated pixel. Based on the two intervals, our method classifies a pixel by determining whether its intensity is within one interval and not in the other. Experiments show that our method improves both the quantity of decoded pixels and the quality of the final reconstruction producing a dense set of 3D points, inclusively for complex scenes with indirect lighting effects. Furthermore, our method does not require newly designed patterns; therefore, it can be easily applied to previously captured data.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Breast symmetry, size, and shape are key components of aesthetic outcomes of augmentation mammoplasty, reduction, and reconstruction. Many have claimed that the 3D scanning technique, which measures breast volumes directly and assesses the asymmetry of the chest and breast on a 3D model, is superior to anthropometric measuring in accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. The documented methods of 3D body surface imaging include laser scanning, stereo photography and so on. To achieve ideal aesthetic results, individualized surgery planning based on a reliable virtual model of the prospective surgery outcome could be of considerable value in decision making and assisting in guidance for the surgery procedure. Additionally, the 3D scanning technique is applicable in postoperative monitoring of morphological change, notably, in a dynamic way. Another distinguishing feature is that it enables virtual division of breast volume, thus surgeons could virtually divide the breast volumes into portions using 3D scanning during the programming and evaluation of surgery plans. However, because 3D surface scanning cannot look through the breast substances and reach the interspace between the chest and posterior border of the breast/dorsal limit of the breast, the inframammary fold in larger breasts cannot be correctly imaged, leaving the preoperative inframammary fold reference lacking. Therefore, 3D scanning is thought to be inaccurate in large and/or ptotic breasts. Another fact that prevents 3D scanning from wide application is its high cost and lack of access.\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

One hundred seventy-eight consecutive women (mean age, 52 years; range, 21?89 years) who underwent US-guided biopsy were imaged with a hand-held probe consisting of a coregistered US transducer and an NIR imager. The lesion location provided by coregistered US was used to guide optical imaging. Light absorption was measured at two optical wavelengths. From this measurement, tumor angiogenesis was assessed on the basis of calculated total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) and was correlated with core biopsy results. For patients diagnosed with carcinomas and followed up with subsequent excision, the tHb was correlated with pathologic parameters.ResultsThere were two in situ carcinomas (Tis), 35 T1 carcinomas, 24 T2?T4 carcinomas, and 114 benign lesions. The mean maximum and mean average tHb of the Tis?T1 group were 102.0 ?mol/L ± 28.5 (standard deviation) and 71.9 ?mol/L ± 18.8, and those of the T2?T4 group were 100.3 ?mol/L ± 26.4 and 67.0 ?mol/L ± 18.3, respectively. The mean maximum and mean average tHb of the benign group were 55.1 ?mol/L ± 22.7 and 39.1 ?mol/L ± 14.9, respectively. Both mean maximum and mean average tHb levels were significantly higher in the malignant groups than they were in the benign group (P < .001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for Tis?T1 cancers were 92%, 93%, 81%, and 97%. The corresponding values for T2?T4 tumors were 75%, 93%, 69%, and 95%.ConclusionThe angiogenesis (tHb) contrast imaged by using the NIR technique with US holds promise as an adjunct to mammography and US for distinguishing early-stage invasive breast cancers from benign lesions.?

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is emerging as a noninvasive functional imaging method for breast cancer diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. In particular, the multimodal approach of combining DOT with x-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is especially synergistic as DBT prior information can be used to enhance the DOT reconstruction. DOT, in turn, provides a functional information overlay onto the mammographic images, increasing sensitivity and specificity to cancer pathology. We describe a dynamic DOT apparatus designed for tight integration with commercial DBT scanners and providing a fast (up to 1 Hz) image acquisition rate to enable tracking hemodynamic changes induced by the mammographic breast compression. The system integrates 96 continuous-wave and 24 frequency-domain source locations as well as 32 continuous wave and 20 frequency-domain detection locations into low-profile plastic plates that can easily mate to the DBT compression paddle and x-ray detector cover, respectively. We demonstrate system performance using static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms as well as in vivo images acquired from the pool of patients recalled for breast biopsies at the Massachusetts General Hospital Breast Imaging Division.},

abstract = {PurposeTo compare the diagnostic performance of breast tomosynthesis versus supplemental mammography views in classification of masses, distortions, and asymmetries.Materials and MethodsEight radiologists who specialized in breast imaging retrospectively reviewed 217 consecutively accrued lesions by using protocols that were HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved in 182 patients aged 31?60 years (mean, 50 years) who underwent diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS?based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy?based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.ResultsAverage probability-of-malignancy?based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001). With tomosynthesis, the false-positive rate decreased from 85% (989 of 1160) to 74% (864 of 1160) (P < .01) for cases that were rated BI-RADS category 3 or higher and from 57% (663 of 1160) to 48% (559 of 1160) for cases rated BI-RADS category 4 or 5 (P < .01), without a meaningful change in sensitivity. With tomosynthesis, more cancers were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (39% [226 of 576] vs 33% [188 of 576]; P = .017) without a decrease in specificity.ConclusionTomosynthesis significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for noncalcified lesions compared with supplemental mammographic views.?
