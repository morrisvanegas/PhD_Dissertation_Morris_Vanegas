\label{chap:omci:introduction}
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with an estimated 1,918,030 new cases in 2022 in the United States alone~\cite{Siegel2022}. X-ray mammography is the primary breast cancer screening technique~\cite{Secretan2015} used for early detection to reduce mortality rates~\cite{Tabar2003}. Despite its recommendation for screening, x-ray mammography suffers from a high false-positive diagnostic rate~\cite{Tabar2003, Elmore1998}. The technique lacks both strong structural contrast between healthy and tumor tissue and the ability to quantify tissue functions to assess benign versus malignancy~\cite{Leff2008}. These limitations have led researchers to investigate using diffuse optical tomography (DOT) techniques to characterize the breast tumor's physiology to lower false-positive diagnoses.
